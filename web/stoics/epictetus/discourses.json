<p>Chapter 1 
</p>


<p>
Of the things which are in our Power, and not in our Power
</p>

<p>
Of all the faculties, you will find not one which is capable of contemplatingitself; and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving.How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? Asfar as forming a judgement about what is written and spoken. And howfar music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them thencontemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write somethingto your friend, grammar will tell you what words you must write; butwhether you should write or not, grammar will not tell you. And soit is with music as to musical sounds; but whether you should singat the present time and play on the lute, or do neither, music willnot tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That which contemplatesboth itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The rationalfaculty; for this is the only faculty that we have received whichexamines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and what is thevalue of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for what elseis there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, for theydo not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is capableof judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar, andother faculties, proves their uses and points out the occasions forusing them? Nothing else. 
</p>

<p>
As then it was fit to be so, that which is best of all and supremeover all is the only thing which the gods have placed in our power,the right use of appearances; but all other things they have not placedin our power. Was it because they did not choose? I indeed think that,if they had been able, they would have put these other things alsoin our power, but they certainly could not. For as we exist on theearth, and are bound to such a body and to such companions, how wasit possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by externals?
</p>

<p>
But what says Zeus? "Epictetus, if it were possible, I would havemade both your little body and your little property free and not exposedto hindrance. But now be not ignorant of this: this body is not yours,but it is clay finely tempered. And since I was not able to do foryou what I have mentioned, I have given you a small portion of us,this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it, and the facultyof desire and aversion, and, in a word, the faculty of using the appearancesof things; and if you will take care of this faculty and considerit your only possession, you will never be hindered, never meet withimpediments; you will not lament, you will not blame, you will notflatter any person." 
</p>

<p>
"Well, do these seem to you small matters?" I hope not. "Be contentwith them then and pray to the gods." But now when it is in our powerto look after one thing, and to attach ourselves to it, we preferto look after many things, and to be bound to many things, to thebody and to property, and to brother and to friend, and to child andto slave. Since, then, we are bound to many things, we are depressedby them and dragged down. For this reason, when the weather is notfit for sailing, we sit down and torment ourselves, and continuallylook out to see what wind is blowing. "It is north." What is thatto us? "When will the west wind blow?" When it shall choose, my goodman, or when it shall please AEolus; for God has not made you themanager of the winds, but AEolus. What then? We must make the bestuse that we can of the things which are in our power, and use therest according to their nature. What is their nature then? As Godmay please. 
</p>

<p>
"Must I, then, alone have my head cut off?" What, would you have allmen lose their heads that you may be consoled? Will you not stretchout your neck as Lateranus did at Rome when Nero ordered him to bebeheaded? For when he had stretched out his neck, and received a feebleblow, which made him draw it in for a moment, he stretched it outagain. And a little before, when he was visited by Epaphroditus, Nero'sfreedman, who asked him about the cause of offense which he had given,he said, "If I choose to tell anything, I will tell your master."
</p>

<p>
What then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances? Whatelse than "What is mine, and what is not mine; and permitted to me,and what is not permitted to me." I must die. Must I then die lamenting?I must be put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile.Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulnessand contentment? "Tell me the secret which you possess." I will not,for this is in my power. "But I will put you in chains." Man, whatare you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but mywill not even Zeus himself can overpower. "I will throw you into prison."My poor body, you mean. "I will cut your head off." When, then, haveI told you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the thingswhich philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily,in which they should exercise themselves. 
</p>

<p>
Thrasea used to say, "I would rather be killed to-day than banishedto-morrow." What, then, did Rufus say to him? "If you choose deathas the heavier misfortune, how great is the folly of your choice?But if, as the lighter, who has given you the choice? Will you notstudy to be content with that which has been given to you?"
</p>

<p>
What, then, did Agrippinus say? He said, "I am not a hindrance tomyself." When it was reported to him that his trial was going on inthe Senate, he said, "I hope it may turn out well; but it is the fifthhour of the day"- this was the time when he was used to exercise himselfand then take the cold bath- "let us go and take our exercise." Afterhe had taken his exercise, one comes and tells him, "You have beencondemned." "To banishment," he replies, "or to death?" "To banishment.""What about my property?" "It is not taken from you." "Let us go toAricia then," he said, "and dine." 
</p>

<p>
This it is to have studied what a man ought to study; to have madedesire, aversion, free from hindrance, and free from all that a manwould avoid. I must die. If now, I am ready to die. If, after a shorttime, I now dine because it is the dinner-hour; after this I willthen die. How? Like a man who gives up what belongs to another.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 2
</p>

<p>
How a Man on every occasion can maintain his Proper Character
</p>

<p>
To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable; but thatwhich is rational is tolerable. Blows are not naturally intolerable."How is that?" See how the Lacedaemonians endure whipping when theyhave learned that whipping is consistent with reason. "To hang yourselfis not intolerable." When, then, you have the opinion that it is rational,you go and hang yourself. In short, if we observe, we shall find thatthe animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational;and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that whichis rational. 
</p>

<p>
But the rational and the irrational appear such in a different wayto different persons, just as the good and the bad, the profitableand the unprofitable. For this reason, particularly, we need discipline,in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational andthe irrational to the several things conformably to nature. But inorder to determine the rational and the irrational, we use not onlythe of external things, but we consider also what is appropriate toeach person. For to one man it is consistent with reason to hold achamber pot for another, and to look to this only, that if he doesnot hold it, he will receive stripes, and he will not receive hisfood: but if he shall hold the pot, he will not suffer anything hardor disagreeable. But to another man not only does the holding of achamber pot appear intolerable for himself, but intolerable also forhim to allow another to do this office for him. If, then, you askme whether you should hold the chamber pot or not, I shall say toyou that the receiving of food is worth more than the not receivingof it, and the being scourged is a greater indignity than not beingscourged; so that if you measure your interests by these things, goand hold the chamber pot. "But this," you say, "would not be worthyof me." Well, then, it is you who must introduce this considerationinto the inquiry, not I; for it is you who know yourself, how muchyou are worth to yourself, and at what price you sell yourself; formen sell themselves at various prices. 
</p>

<p>
For this reason, when Florus was deliberating whether he should godown to Nero's spectacles and also perform in them himself, Agrippinussaid to him, "Go down": and when Florus asked Agrippinus, "Why donot you go down?" Agrippinus replied, "Because I do not even deliberateabout the matter." For he who has once brought himself to deliberateabout such matters, and to calculate the value of external things,comes very near to those who have forgotten their own character. Forwhy do you ask me the question, whether death is preferable or life?I say "life." "Pain or pleasure?" I say "pleasure." But if I do nottake a part in the tragic acting, I shall have my head struck off.Go then and take a part, but I will not. "Why?" Because you consideryourself to be only one thread of those which are in the tunic. Wellthen it was fitting for you to take care how you should be like therest of men, just as the thread has no design to be anything superiorto the other threads. But I wish to be purple, that small part whichis bright, and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful. Whythen do you tell me to make myself like the many? and if I do, howshall I still be purple? 
</p>

<p>
Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. For when Vespasiansent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied, "Itis in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, butso long as I am, I must go in." "Well, go in then," says the emperor,"but say nothing." "Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent.""But I must ask your opinion." "And I must say what I think right.""But if you do, I shall put you to death." "When then did I tell youthat I am immortal? You will do your part, and I will do mine: itis your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not in fear: yours tobanish me; mine to depart without sorrow." 
</p>

<p>
What good then did Priscus do, who was only a single person? And whatgood does the purple do for the toga? Why, what else than this, thatit is conspicuous in the toga as purple, and is displayed also asa fine example to all other things? But in such circumstances anotherwould have replied to Caesar who forbade him to enter the senate,"I thank you for sparing me." But such a man Vespasian would not evenhave forbidden to enter the senate, for he knew that he would eithersit there like an earthen vessel, or, if he spoke, he would say whatCaesar wished, and add even more. 
</p>

<p>
In this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of dying unlesshis private parts were amputated. His brother came to the athlete,who was a philosopher, and said, "Come, brother, what are you goingto do? Shall we amputate this member and return to the gymnasium?"But the athlete persisted in his resolution and died. When some oneasked Epictetus how he did this, as an athlete or a philosopher, "Asa man," Epictetus replied, "and a man who had been proclaimed amongthe athletes at the Olympic games and had contended in them, a manwho had been familiar with such a place, and not merely anointed inBaton's school. Another would have allowed even his head to be cutoff, if he could have lived without it. Such is that regard to characterwhich is so strong in those who have been accustomed to introduceit of themselves and conjoined with other things into their deliberations."
</p>

<p>
"Come, then, Epictetus, shave yourself." "If I am a philosopher,"I answer, "I will not shave myself." "But I will take off your head?"If that will do you any good, take it off. 
</p>

<p>
Some person asked, "How then shall every man among us perceive whatis suitable to his character?" How, he replied, does the bull alone,when the lion has attacked, discover his own powers and put himselfforward in defense of the whole herd? It is plain that with the powersthe perception of having them is immediately conjoined; and, therefore,whoever of us has such powers will not be ignorant of them. Now abull is not made suddenly, nor a brave man; but we must disciplineourselves in the winter for the summer campaign, and not rashly runupon that which does not concern us. 
</p>

<p>
Only consider at what price you sell your own will; if for no otherreason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum. Butthat which is great and superior perhaps belongs to Socrates and suchas are like him. "Why then, if we are naturally such, are not a verygreat number of us like him?" Is it true then that all horses becomeswift, that all dogs are skilled in tracking footprints? "What, then,since I am naturally dull, shall I, for this reason, take no pains?"I hope not. Epictetus is not superior to Socrates; but if he is notinferior, this is enough for me; for I shall never be a Milo, andyet I do not neglect my body; nor shall I be a Croesus, and yet Ido not neglect my property; nor, in a word, do we neglect lookingafter anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 3
</p>

<p>
How a man should proceed from the principle of God being the fatherof all men to the rest 
</p>

<p>
If a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought, thatwe are all sprung from God in an especial manner, and that God isthe father both of men and of gods, I suppose that he would neverhave any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself. But if Caesar shouldadopt you, no one could endure your arrogance; and if you know thatyou are the son of Zeus, will you not be elated? Yet we do not so;but since these two things are mingled in the generation of man, bodyin common with the animals, and reason and intelligence in commonwith the gods, many incline to this kinship, which is miserable andmortal; and some few to that which is divine and happy. Since thenit is of necessity that every man uses everything according to theopinion which he has about it, those, the few, who think that theyare formed for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearanceshave no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves; but with the manyit is quite the contrary. For they say, "What am I? A poor, miserableman, with my wretched bit of flesh." Wretched. Indeed; but you possesssomething better than your "bit of flesh." Why then do you neglectthat which is better, and why do you attach yourself to this?
</p>

<p>
Through this kinship with the flesh, some of us inclining to it becomelike wolves, faithless and treacherous and mischievous: some becomelike lions, savage and untamed; but the greater part of us becomefoxes and other worse animals. For what else is a slanderer and amalignant man than a fox, or some other more wretched and meaner animal?See, then, and take care that you do not become some one of thesemiserable things. 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 4
</p>

<p>
Of progress or improvement 
</p>

<p>
He who is making progress, having learned from philosophers that desiremeans the desire of good things, and aversion means aversion frombad things; having learned too that happiness and tranquillity arenot attainable by man otherwise than by not failing to obtain whathe desires, and not falling into that which he would avoid; such aman takes from himself desire altogether and defers it, but he employshis aversion only on things which are dependent on his will. For ifhe attempts to avoid anything independent of his will, he knows thatsometimes he will fall in with something which he wishes to avoid,and he will be unhappy. Now if virtue promises good fortune and tranquillityand happiness, certainly also the progress toward virtue is progresstoward each of these things. For it is always true that to whateverpoint the perfecting of anything leads us, progress is an approachtoward this point. 
</p>

<p>
How then do we admit that virtue is such as I have said, and yet seekprogress in other things and make a display of it? What is the productof virtue? Tranquillity. Who then makes improvement? It is he whohas read many books of Chrysippus? But does virtue consist in havingunderstood Chrysippus? If this is so, progress is clearly nothingelse than knowing a great deal of Chrysippus. But now we admit thatvirtue produces one thing. and we declare that approaching near toit is another thing, namely, progress or improvement. "Such a person,"says one, "is already able to read Chrysippus by himself." Indeed,sir, you are making great progress. What kind of progress? But whydo you mock the man? Why do you draw him away from the perceptionof his own misfortunes? Will you not show him the effect of virtuethat he may learn where to look for improvement? Seek it there, wretch,where your work lies. And where is your work? In desire and in aversion,that you may not be disappointed in your desire, and that you maynot fall into that which you would avoid; in your pursuit and avoiding,that you commit no error; in assent and suspension of assent, thatyou be not deceived. The first things, and the most necessary, arethose which I have named. But if with trembling and lamentation youseek not to fall into that which you avoid, tell me how you are improving.
</p>

<p>
Do you then show me your improvement in these things? If I were talkingto an athlete, I should say, "Show me your shoulders"; and then hemight say, "Here are my halteres." You and your halteres look to that.I should reply, "I wish to see the effect of the halteres." So, whenyou say: "Take the treatise on the active powers, and see how I havestudied it." I reply, "Slave, I am not inquiring about this, but howyou exercise pursuit and avoidance, desire and aversion, how yourdesign and purpose and prepare yourself, whether conformably to natureor not. If conformably, give me evidence of it, and I will say thatyou are making progress: but if not conformably, be gone, and notonly expound your books, but write such books yourself; and what willyou gain by it? Do you not know that the whole book costs only fivedenarii? Does then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii?Never, then, look for the matter itself in one place, and progresstoward it in another." 
</p>

<p>
Where then is progress? If any of you, withdrawing himself from externals,turns to his own will to exercise it and to improve it by labour,so as to make it conformable to nature, elevated, free, unrestrained,unimpeded, faithful, modest; and if he has learned that he who desiresor avoids the things which are not in his power can neither be faithfulnor free, but of necessity he must change with them and be tossedabout with them as in a tempest, and of necessity must subject himselfto others who have the power to procure or prevent what he desiresor would avoid; finally, when he rises in the morning, if he observesand keeps these rules, bathes as a man of fidelity, eats as a modestman; in like manner, if in every matter that occurs he works out hischief principles as the runner does with reference to running, andthe trainer of the voice with reference to the voice- this is theman who truly makes progress, and this is the man who has not traveledin vain. But if he has strained his efforts to the practice of readingbooks, and labours only at this, and has traveled for this, I tellhim to return home immediately, and not to neglect his affairs there;for this for which he has traveled is nothing. But the other thingis something, to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation andgroaning, and saying, "Woe to me," and "wretched that I am," and torid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what deathis, and exile, and prison, and poison, that he may be able to saywhen he is in fetters, "Dear Crito, if it is the will of the godsthat it be so, let it be so"; and not to say, "Wretched am I, an oldman; have I kept my gray hairs for this?" Who is it that speaks thus?Do you think that I shall name some man of no repute and of low condition?Does not Priam say this? Does not OEdipus say this? Nay, all kingssay it! For what else is tragedy than the perturbations of men whovalue externals exhibited in this kind of poetry? But if a man mustlearn by fiction that no external things which are independent ofthe will concern us, for this? part I should like this fiction, bythe aid of which I should live happily and undisturbed. But you mustconsider for yourselves what you wish. 
</p>

<p>
What then does Chrysippus teach us? The reply is, "to know that thesethings are not false, from which happiness comes and tranquillityarises. Take my books, and you will learn how true and conformableto nature are the things which make me free from perturbations." Ogreat good fortune! O the great benefactor who points out the way!To Triptolemus all men have erected temples and altars, because hegave us food by cultivation; but to him who discovered truth and broughtit to light and communicated it to all, not the truth which showsus how to live, but how to live well, who of you for this reason hasbuilt an altar, or a temple, or has dedicated a statue, or who worshipsGod for this? Because the gods have given the vine, or wheat, we sacrificeto them: but because they have produced in the human mind that fruitby which they designed to show us the truth which relates to happiness,shall we not thank God for this? 
</p>

<p>
Chapter 5
</p>

<p>
Against the academics 
</p>

<p>
If a man, said Epictetus, opposes evident truths, it is not easy tofind arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion. Butthis does not arise either from the man's strength or the teacher'sweakness; for when the man, though he has been confuted, is hardenedlike a stone, how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument?
</p>

<p>
Now there are two kinds of hardening, one of the understanding, theother of the sense of shame, when a man is resolved not to assentto what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions. Most of usare afraid of mortification of the body, and would contrive all meansto avoid such a thing, but we care not about the soul's mortification.And indeed with regard to the soul, if a man be in such a state asnot to apprehend anything, or understand at all, we think that heis in a bad condition: but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened,this we call even power. 
</p>

<p>
Do you comprehend that you are awake? "I do not," the man replies,"for I do not even comprehend when in my sleep I imagine that I amawake." Does this appearance then not differ from the other? "Notat all," he replies. Shall I still argue with this man? And what fireor what iron shall I apply to him to make him feel that he is deadened?He does perceive, but he pretends that he does not. He's even worsethan a dead man. He does not see the contradiction: he is in a badcondition. Another does see it, but he is not moved, and makes noimprovement: he is even in a worse condition. His modesty is extirpated,and his sense of shame; and the rational faculty has not been cutoff from him, but it is brutalized. Shall I name this strength ofmind? Certainly not, unless we also name it such in catamites, throughwhich they do and say in public whatever comes into their head.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 6
</p>

<p>
Of providence 
</p>

<p>
From everything which is or happens in the world, it is easy to praiseProvidence, if a man possesses these two qualities, the faculty ofseeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things, and a gratefuldisposition. If he does not possess these two qualities, one man willnot see the use of things which are and which happen; another willnot be thankful for them, even if he does know them. If God had madecolours, but had not made the faculty of seeing them, what would havebeen their use? None at all. On the other hand, if He had made thefaculty of vision, but had not made objects such as to fall underthe faculty, what in that case also would have been the use of it?None at all. Well, suppose that He had made both, but had not madelight? In that case, also, they would have been of no use. Who isit, then, who has fitted this to that and that to this? And who isit that has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife?Is it no one? And, indeed, from the very structure of things whichhave attained their completion, we are accustomed to show that thework is certainly the act of some artificer, and that it has not beenconstructed without a purpose. Does then each of these things demonstratethe workman, and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing andlight demonstrate Him? And the existence of male and female, and thedesire of each for conjunction, and the power of using the parts whichare constructed, do not even these declare the workman? If they donot, let us consider the constitution of our understanding accordingto which, when we meet with sensible objects, we simply receive impressionsfrom them, but we also select something from them, and subtract something,and add, and compound by means of them these things or those, and,in fact, pass from some to other things which, in a manner, resemblethem: is not even this sufficient to move some men, and to inducethem not to forget the workman? If not so, let them explain to uswhat it is that makes each several thing, or how it is possible thatthings so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should existby chance and from their own proper motion? 
</p>

<p>
What, then, are these things done in us only. Many, indeed, in usonly, of which the rational animal had peculiar need; but you willfind many common to us with irrational animals. Do they them understandwhat is done? By no means. For use is one thing, and understandingis another: God had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances,but of us to understand the use of appearances. It is therefore enoughfor them to eat and to drink, and to sleep and to copulate, and todo all the other things which they severally do. But for us, to whomHe has given also the faculty, these things are not sufficient; forunless we act in a proper and orderly manner, and conformably to thenature and constitution of each thing, we shall never attain our trueend. For where the constitutions of living beings are different, therealso the acts and the ends are different. In those animals, then,whose constitution is adapted only to use, use alone is enough: butin an animal which has also the power of understanding the use, unlessthere be the due exercise of the understanding, he will never attainhis proper end. Well then God constitutes every animal, one to beeaten, another to serve for agriculture, another to supply cheese,and another for some like use; for which purposes what need is thereto understand appearances and to be able to distinguish them? ButGod has introduced man to be a spectator of God and of His works;and not only a spectator of them, but an interpreter. For this reasonit is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animalsdo, but rather he ought to begin where they begin, and to end wherenature ends in us; and nature ends in contemplation and understanding,in a way of life conformable to nature. Take care then not to diewithout having been spectators of these things. 
</p>

<p>
But you take a journey to Olympia to see the work of Phidias, andall of you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things.But when there is no need to take a journey, and where a man is, therehe has the works (of God) before him, will you not desire to see andunderstand them? Will you not perceive either what you are, or whatyou were born for, or what this is for which you have received thefaculty of sight? But you may say, "There are some things disagreeableand troublesome in life." And are there none in Olympia? Are you notscorched? Are you not pressed by a crowd? Are you not without comfortablemeans of bathing? Are you not wet when it rains? Have you not abundanceof noise, clamour, and other disagreeable things? But I suppose thatsetting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle,you bear and endure. Well, then, and have you not received facultiesby which you will be able to bear all that happens? Have you not receivedgreatness of soul? Have you not received manliness? Have you not receivedendurance? And why do I trouble myself about anything that can happenif I possess greatness of soul? What shall distract my mind or disturbme, or appear painful? Shall I not use the power for the purposesfor which I received it, and shall I grieve and lament over what happens?
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but my nose runs." For what purpose then, slave, have you hands?Is it not that you may wipe your nose? "Is it, then, consistent withreason that there should be running of noses in the world?" Nay, howmuch better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault. What do youthink that Hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion,and hydra, and stag, and boar, and certain unjust and bestial men,whom Hercules used to drive away and clear out? And what would hehave been doing if there had been nothing of the kind? Is it not plainthat he would have wrapped himself up and have slept? In the firstplace, then he would not have been a Hercules, when he was dreamingaway all his life in such luxury and case; and even if he had beenone what would have been the use of him? and what the use of his arms,and of the strength of the other parts of his body, and his enduranceand noble spirit, if such circumstances and occasions had not rousedand exercised him? "Well, then, must a man provide for himself suchmeans of exercise, and to introduce a lion from some place into hiscountry, and a boar and a hydra?" This would be folly and madness:but as they did exist, and were found, they were useful for showingwhat Hercules was and for exercising him. Come then do you also havingobserved these things look to the faculties which you have, and whenyou have looked at them, say: "Bring now, O Zeus, any difficulty thatThou pleasest, for I have means given to me by Thee and powers forhonoring myself through the things which happen." You do not so; butyou sit still, trembling for fear that some things will happen, andweeping, and lamenting and groaning for what does happen: and thenyou blame the gods. For what is the consequence of such meanness ofspirit but impiety? And yet God has not only given us these faculties;by which we shall be able to bear everything that happens withoutbeing depressed or broken by it; but, like a good king and a truefather, He has given us these faculties free from hindrance, subjectto no compulsion unimpeded, and has put them entirely in our own power,without even having reserved to Himself any power of hindering orimpeding. You, who have received these powers free and as your own,use them not: you do not even see what you have received, and fromwhom; some of you being blinded to the giver, and not even acknowledgingyour benefactor, and others, through meanness of spirit, betakingyourselves to fault finding and making charges against God. Yet Iwill show to you that you have powers and means for greatness of souland manliness but what powers you have for finding fault and makingaccusations, do you show me.

Chapter 7
</p>

<p>
Of the use of sophistical arguments, and hypothetical, and the like
</p>

The handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments, and of thosewhich derive their conclusions from questioning, and in a word thehandling of all such arguments, relates to the duties of life, thoughthe many do not know this truth. For in every matter we inquire howthe wise and good man shall discover the proper path and the propermethod of dealing with the matter. Let, then, people either say thatthe grave man will not descend into the contest of question and answer,or that, if he does descend into the contest, he will take no careabout not conducting himself rashly or carelessly in questioning andanswering. But if they do not allow either the one or the other ofthese things, they must admit that some inquiry ought to be made intothose topics on which particularly questioning and answering are employed.For what is the end proposed in reasoning? To establish true propositions,to remove the false, to withhold assent from those which are not plain.Is it enough then to have learned only this? "It is enough," a manmay reply. Is it, then, also enough for a man, who would not makea mistake in the use of coined money, to have heard this precept,that he should receive the genuine drachmae and reject the spurious?"It is not enough." What, then, ought to be added to this precept?What else than the faculty which proves and distinguishes the genuineand the spurious drachmae? Consequently also in reasoning what hasbeen said is not enough; but is it necessary that a man should acquirethe faculty of examining and distinguishing the true and the false,and that which is not plain? "It is necessary." Besides this, whatis proposed in reasoning? "That you should accept what follows fromthat which you have properly granted." Well, is it then enough inthis case also to know this? It is not enough; but a man must learnhow one thing is a consequence of other things, and when one thingfollows from one thing, and when it follows from several collectively.Consider, then if it be not necessary that this power should alsobe acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in reasoning,the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he hasproposed, and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others,including of not being deceived by sophists, as if they were demonstrating.Therefore there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusivearguments and figures, and it has been shown to be necessary.
</p>

<p>
But in fact in some cases we have properly granted the premisses orassumptions, and there results from them something; and though itis not true, yet none the less it does result. What then ought I todo? Ought I to admit the falsehood? And how is that possible? Well,should I say that I did not properly grant that which we agreed upon?"But you are not allowed to do even this." Shall I then say that theconsequence does not arise through what has been conceded? "But neitheris it allowed." What then must be done in this case? Consider if itis not this: as to have borrowed is not enough to make a man stilla debtor, but to this must be added the fact that he continues toowe the money and that the debt is not paid, so it is not enough tocompel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premisses,but you must abide by what you have granted. Indeed, if the premissescontinue to the end such as they were when they were granted, it isabsolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted, andwe must accept their consequences: but if the premisses do not remainsuch as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessaryfor us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting whatdoes not follow from the words in which our concessions were made.For the inference is now not our inference, nor does it result withour assent, since we have withdrawn from the premisses which we granted.We ought then both to examine such kind of premisses, and such changeand variation of them, by which in the course of questioning or answering,or in making the syllogistic conclusion, or in any other such way,the premisses undergo variations, and give occasion to the foolishto be confounded, if they do not see what conclusions are. For whatreason ought we to examine? In order that we may not in this matterbe employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way.
</p>

<p>
And the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments; for it is necessarysometimes to demand the granting of some hypothesis as a kind of passageto the argument which follows. Must we then allow every hypothesisthat is proposed, or not allow every one? And if not every one, whichshould we allow? And if a man has allowed an hypothesis, must he inevery case abide by allowing it? or must he sometimes withdraw fromit, but admit the consequences and not admit contradictions? Yes;but suppose that a man says, "If you admit the hypothesis of a possibility,I will draw you to an impossibility." With such a person shall a manof sense refuse to enter into a contest, and avoid discussion andconversation with him? But what other man than the man of sense canuse argumentation and is skillful in questioning and answering, andincapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning? And shallhe enter into the contest, and yet not take care whether he shallengage in argument not rashly and not carelessly? And if he does nottake care, how can he be such a man as we conceive him to be? Butwithout some such exercise and preparation, can he maintain a continuousand consistent argument? Let them show this; and all these speculationsbecome superfluous, and are absurd and inconsistent with our notionof a good and serious man. 
</p>

<p>
Why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish, and why do weseek pretences for not labouring and not being watchful in cultivatingour reason? "If then I shall make a mistake in these matters may Inot have killed my father?" Slave, where was there a father in thismatter that you could kill him? What, then, have you done? The onlyfault that was possible here is the fault which you have committed.This is the very remark which I made to Rufus when he blamed me fornot having discovered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism:"I suppose," I said, "that I have burnt the Capitol." "Slave," hereplied, "was the thing omitted here the Capitol?" Or are these theonly crimes, to burn the Capitol and to kill your father? But fora man to use the appearances resented to him rashly and foolishlyand carelessly, not to understand argument, nor demonstration, norsophism, nor, in a word, to see in questioning and answering whatis consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent;is there no error in this?

<p>
That the faculties are not safe to the uninstructed 
</p>

<p>
In as many ways as we can change things which are equivalent to oneanother, in just so many ways we can change the forms of argumentsand enthymemes in argumentation. This is an instance: "If you haveborrowed and not repaid, you owe me the money: you have not borrowedand you have not repaid; then you do not owe me the money." To dothis skillfully is suitable to no man more than to the philosopher;for if the enthymeme is all imperfect syllogism. it is plain thathe who has been exercised in the perfect syllogism must be equallyexpert in the imperfect also. 
</p>

<p>
"Why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another in this manner?"Because, I reply, at present, though we are not exercised in thesethings and not distracted from the study of morality, by me at least,still we make no progress in virtue. What then must we expect if weshould add this occupation? and particularly as this would not onlybe an occupation which would withdraw us from more necessary things,but would also be a cause of self conceit and arrogance, and no smallcause. For great is the power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion,and particularly if it should be much exercised, and also receiveadditional ornament from language: and so universally, every facultyacquired by the uninstructed and weak brings with it the danger ofthese persons being elated and inflated by it. For by what means couldone persuade a young man who excels in these matters that he oughtnot to become an appendage to them, but to make them an appendageto himself? Does he not trample on all such reasons, and strut beforeus elated and inflated, not enduring that any man should reprove himand remind him of what he has neglected and to what he has turnedaside?

"What, then, was not Plato a philosopher?" I reply, "And was not Hippocratesa physician? but you see how Hippocrates speaks." Does Hippocrates,then, speak thus in respect of being a physician? Why do you minglethings which have been accidentally united in the same men? And ifPlato was handsome and strong, ought I also to set to work and endeavorto become handsome or strong, as if this was necessary for philosophy,because a certain philosopher was at the same time handsome and aphilosopher? Will you not choose to see and to distinguish in respectto what men become philosophers, and what things belong to belongto them in other respects? And if I were a philosopher, ought youalso to be made lame? What then? Do I take away these faculties whichyou possess? By no means; for neither do I take away the faculty ofseeing. But if you ask me what is the good of man, I cannot mentionto you anything else than that it is a certain disposition of thewill with respect to appearances.

How from the fact that we are akin to God a man may proceed to theconsequences

If the things are true which are said by the philosophers about thekinship between God and man, what else remains for men to do thenwhat Socrates did? Never in reply to the question, to what countryyou belong, say that you are an Athenian or a Corinthian, but thatyou are a citizen of the world. For why do you say that you are anAthenian, and why do you not say that you belong to the small nookonly into which your poor body was cast at birth? Is it not plainthat you call yourself an Athenian or Corinthian from the place whichhas a greater authority and comprises not only that small nook itselfand all your family, but even the whole country from which the stockof your progenitors is derived down to you? He then who has observedwith intelligence the administration of the world, and has learnedthat the greatest and supreme and the most comprehensive communityis that which is composed of men and God, and that from God have descendedthe seeds not only to my father and grandfather, but to all beingswhich are generated on the earth and are produced, and particularlyto rational beings- for these only are by their nature formed to havecommunion with God, being by means of reason conjoined with Him- whyshould not such a man call himself a citizen of the world, why nota son of God, and why should he be afraid of anything which happensamong men? Is kinship with Caesar or with any other of the powerfulin Rome sufficient to enable us to live in safety, and above contemptand without any fear at all? and to have God for your maker and fatherand guardian, shall not this release us from sorrows and fears?

But a man may say, "Whence shall I get bread to eat when I have nothing?"

<p>
And how do slaves, and runaways, on what do they rely when they leavetheir masters? Do they rely on their lands or slaves, or their vesselsof silver? They rely on nothing but themselves, and food does notfail them. And shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopherto travel into foreign parts, and trust to and rely on others, andnot to take care of himself, and shall he be inferior to irrationalanimals and more cowardly, each of which, being self-sufficient, neitherfails to get its proper food, nor to find a suitable way of living,and one conformable to nature? 
</p>

<p>
I indeed think that the old man ought to be sitting here, not to contrivehow you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble talk aboutyourselves, but to take care that there be not among us any youngmen of such a mind that, when they have recognized their kinship toGod, and that we are fettered by these bonds, the body, I mean, andits possessions, and whatever else on account of them is necessaryto us for the economy and commerce of life, they should intend tothrow off these things as if they were burdens painful and intolerable,and to depart to their kinsmen. But this is the labour that your teacherand instructor ought to be employed upon, if he really were what heshould be. You should come to him and say, "Epictetus, we can no longerendure being bound to this poor body, and feeding it and giving itdrink, and rest, and cleaning it, and for the sake of the body complyingwith the wishes of these and of those. Are not these things indifferentand nothing to us, and is not death no evil? And are we not in a mannerkinsmen of God, and did we not come from Him? Allow us to depart tothe place from which we came; allow us to be released at last fromthese bonds by which we are bound and weighed down. Here there arerobbers and thieves and courts of justice, and those who are namedtyrants, and think that they have some power over us by means of thebody and its possessions. Permit us to show them that they have nopower over any man." And I on my part would say, "Friends, wait forGod; when He shall give the signal and release you from this service,then go to Him; but for the present endure to dwell in this placewhere He has put you: short indeed is this time of your dwelling here,and easy to bear for those who are so disposed: for what tyrant orwhat thief, or what courts of justice, are formidable to those whohave thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessionsof the body? Wait then, do not depart without a reason."
</p>

<p>
Something like this ought to be said by the teacher to ingenuous youths.But now what happens? The teacher is a lifeless body, and you arelifeless bodies. When you have been well filled to-day, you sit downand lament about the morrow, how you shall get something to eat. Wretch,if you have it, you will have it; if you have it not, you will departfrom life. The door is open. Why do you grieve? where does there remainany room for tears? and where is there occasion for flattery? whyshall one man envy another? why should a man admire the rich or thepowerful, even if they be both very strong and of violent temper?for what will they do to us? We shall not care for that which theycan do; and what we do care for, that they cannot do. How did Socratesbehave with respect to these matters? Why, in what other way thana man ought to do who was convinced that he was a kinsman of the gods?"If you say to me now," said Socrates to his judges, "'We will acquityou on the condition that you no longer discourse in the way in whichyou have hitherto discoursed, nor trouble either our young or ourold men,' I shall answer, 'you make yourselves ridiculous by thinkingthat, if one of our commanders has appointed me to a certain post,it is my duty to keep and maintain it, and to resolve to die a thousandtimes rather than desert it; but if God has put us in any place andway of life, we ought to desert it.'" Socrates speaks like a man whois really a kinsman of the gods. But we think about ourselves as ifwe were only stomachs, and intestines, and shameful parts; we fear,we desire; we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters,and we fear them also.

A man asked me to write to Rome about him, a man who, as most peoplethought, had been unfortunate, for formerly he was a man of rank andrich, but had been stripped of all, and was living here. I wrote onhis behalf in a submissive manner; but when he had read the letter,he gave it back to me and said, "I wished for your help, not yourpity: no evil has happened to me." 
</p>

<p>
Thus also Musonius Rufus, in order to try me, used to say: "This andthis will befall you from your master"; and I replied that these werethings which happen in the ordinary course of human affairs. "Why,then," said he, "should I ask him for anything when I can obtain itfrom you?" For, in fact, what a man has from himself, it is superfluousand foolish to receive from another? Shall I, then, who am able toreceive from myself greatness of soul and a generous spirit, receivefrom you land and money or a magisterial office? I hope not: I willnot be so ignorant about my own possessions. But when a man is cowardlyand mean, what else must be done for him than to write letters asyou would about a corpse. "Please to grant us the body of a certainperson and a sextarius of poor blood." For such a person is, in fact,a carcass and a sextarius of blood, and nothing more. But if he wereanything more, he would know that one man is not miserable throughthe means of another.

<p>
Against those who eagerly seek preferment at Rome 
</p>

<p>
If we applied ourselves as busily to our own work as the old men atRome do to those matters about which they are employed, perhaps wealso might accomplish something. I am acquainted with a man olderthan myself who is now superintendent of corn at Rome, and rememberthe time when he came here on his way back from exile, and what hesaid as he related the events of his former life, and how he declaredthat with respect to the future after his return he would look afternothing else than passing the rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity."For how little of life," he said, remains for me." I replied, "Youwill not do it, but as soon as you smell Rome, you will forget allthat you have said; and if admission is allowed even into the imperialpalace, you will gladly thrust yourself in and thank God." "If youfind me, Epictetus," he answered, "setting even one foot within thepalace, think what you please." Well, what then did he do? Beforehe entered the city he was met by letters from Caesar, and as soonas he received them he forgot all, and ever after has added one pieceof business to another. I wish that I were now by his side to remindhim of what he said when he was passing this way and to tell him howmuch better a seer I am than he is. 
</p>

<p>
Well, then, do I say that man is an animal made for doing nothing?Certainly not. But why are we not active? For example, as to myself,as soon as day comes, in a few words I remind myself of what I mustread over to my pupils; then forthwith I say to myself, "But whatis it to me how a certain person shall read? the first thing for meis to sleep." And indeed what resemblance is there between what otherpersons do and what we do? If you observe what they do, you will understand.And what else do they do all day long than make up accounts, inquireamong themselves, give and take advice about some small quantity ofgrain, a bit of land, and such kind of profits? Is it then the samething to receive a petition and to read in it: "I entreat you to permitme to export a small quantity of corn"; and one to this effect: "Ientreat you to learn from Chrysippus what is the administration ofthe world, and what place in it the rational animal holds; consideralso who you are, and what is the nature of your good and bad." Arethese things like the other, do they require equal care, and is itequally base to neglect these and those? Well, then, are we the onlypersons who are lazy and love sleep? No; but much rather you youngmen are. For we old men, when we see young men amusing themselves,are eager to play with them; and if I saw you active and zealous,much more should I be eager myself to join you in your serious pursuits.

Chapter 11
</p>

<p>
Of natural affection 
</p>

<p>
When he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus inquiredof him about several particulars, and asked if he had children anda wife. The man replied that he had; and Epictetus inquired further,how he felt under the circumstances. "Miserable," the man said. ThenEpictetus asked, "In what respect," for men do not marry and begetchildren in order to be wretched, but rather to be happy. "But I,"the man replied, "am so wretched about my children that lately, whenmy little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger, I couldnot endure to stay with her, but I left home till a person sent menews that she had recovered." Well then, said Epictetus, do you thinkthat you acted right? "I acted naturally," the man replied. But convinceme of this that you acted naturally, and I will convince you thateverything which takes place according to nature takes place rightly."This is the case," said the man, "with all or at least most fathers."I do not deny that: but the matter about which we are inquiring iswhether such behavior is right; for in respect to this matter we mustsay that tumours also come for the good of the body, because theydo come; and generally we must say that to do wrong is natural, becausenearly all or at least most of us do wrong. Do you show me then howyour behavior is natural. "I cannot," he said; "but do you rathershow me how it is not according to nature and is not rightly done.
</p>

<p>
Well, said Epictetus, if we were inquiring about white and black,what criterion should we employ for distinguishing between them? "Thesight," he said. And if about hot and cold, and hard and soft, whatcriterion? "The touch." Well then, since we are inquiring about thingswhich are according to nature, and those which are done rightly ornot rightly, what kind of criterion do you think that we should employ?"I do not know," he said. And yet not to know the criterion of colorsand smells, and also of tastes, is perhaps no great harm; but if aman do not know the criterion of good and bad, and of things accordingto nature and contrary to nature, does this seem to you a small harm?"The greatest harm." Come tell me, do all things which seem to somepersons to be good and becoming rightly appear such; and at presentas to Jews and Syrians and Egyptians and Romans, is it possible thatthe opinions of all of them in respect to food are right? "How isit possible?" he said. Well, I suppose it is absolutely necessarythat, if the opinions of the Egyptians are right, the opinions ofthe rest must be wrong: if the opinions of the Jews are right, thoseof the rest cannot be right. "Certainly." But where there is ignorance,there also there is want of learning and training in things whichare necessary. He assented to this. You then, said Epictetus, sinceyou know this, for the future will employ yourself seriously aboutnothing else, and will apply your mind to nothing else than to learnthe criterion of things which are according to nature, and by usingit also to determine each several thing. But in the present matterI have so much as this to aid you toward what you wish. Does affectionto those of your family appear to you to be according to nature andto be good? "Certainly." Well, is such affection natural and good,and is a thing consistent with reason not good? "By no means." Isthen that which is consistent with reason in contradiction with affection?"I think not." You are right, for if it is otherwise, it is necessarythat one of the contradictions being according to nature, the othermust be contrary to nature. Is it not so? "It is," he said. Whatever,then, we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate and alsoconsistent with reason, this we confidently declare to be right andgood. "Agreed." Well then to leave your sick child and to go awayis not reasonable, and I suppose that you will not say that it is;but it remains for us to inquire if it is consistent with affection."Yes, let us consider." Did you, then, since you had an affectionatedisposition to your child, do right when you ran off and left her;and has the mother no affection for the child? "Certainly, she has."Ought, then, the mother also to have left her, or ought she not? "Sheought not." And the nurse, does she love her? "She does." Ought, then,she also to have left her? "By no means." And the pedagogue, doeshe not love her? "He does love her." Ought, then, he also to havedeserted her? and so should the child have been left alone and withouthelp on account of the great affection of you, the parents, and ofthose about her, or should she have died in the hands of those whoneither loved her nor cared for her? "Certainly not." Now this isunfair and unreasonable, not to allow those who have equal affectionwith yourself to do what you think to be proper for yourself to dobecause you have affection. It is absurd. Come then, if you were sick,would you wish your relations to be so affectionate, and all the rest,children and wife, as to leave you alone and deserted? "By no means."And would you wish to be so loved by your own that through their excessiveaffection you would always be left alone in sickness? or for thisreason would you rather pray, if it were possible, to be loved byyour enemies and deserted by them? But if this is so, it results thatyour behavior was not at all an affectionate act. 
</p>

<p>
Well then, was it nothing which moved you and induced you to desertyour child? and how is that possible? But it might be something ofthe kind which moved a man at Rome to wrap up his head while a horsewas running which he favoured; and when contrary to expectation thehorse won, he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit. Whatthen is the thing which moved? The exact discussion of this does notbelong to the present occasion perhaps; but it is enough to be convincedof this, if what the philosophers say is true, that we must not lookfor it anywhere without, but in all cases it is one and the same thingwhich is the cause of our doing or not doing something, of sayingor not saying something, of being elated or depressed, of avoidinganything or pursuing: the very thing which is now the cause to meand to you, to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing, and tome of saying what I do say. And what is this? Is it any other thanour will to do so? "No other." But if we had willed otherwise, whatelse should we have been doing than that which we willed to do? This,then, was the cause of Achilles' lamentation, not the death of Patroclus;for another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion;but it was because he chose to do so. And to you this was the verycause of your then running away, that you chose to do so; and on theother side, if you should stay with her, the reason will be the same.And now you are going to Rome because you choose; and if you shouldchange your mind, you will not go thither. And in a word, neitherdeath nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause ofour doing anything or not doing; but our own opinions and our wills.
</p>

<p>
Do I convince you of this or not? "You do convince me." Such, then,as the causes are in each case, such also are the effects. When, then,we are doing anything not rightly, from this day we shall impute itto nothing else than to the will from which we have done it: and itis that which we shall endeavour to take away and to extirpate morethan the tumours and abscesses out of the body. And in like mannerwe shall give the same account of the cause of the things which wedo right; and we shall no longer allege as causes of any evil to us,either slave or neighbour, or wife or children, being persuaded that,if we do not think things to he what we do think them to be, we donot the acts which follow from such opinions; and as to thinking ornot thinking, that is in our power and not in externals. "It is so,"he said. From this day then we shall inquire into and examine nothingelse, what its quality is, or its state, neither land nor slaves norhorses nor dogs, nothing else than opinions. "I hope so." You see,then, that you must become a Scholasticus, an animal whom all ridicule,if you really intend to make an examination of your own opinions:and that this is not the work of one hour or day, you know yourself.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 12
</p>

<p>
Of contentment 
</p>

<p>
With respect to gods, there are some who say that a divine being doesnot exist: others say that it exists, but is inactive and careless,and takes no forethought about anything; a third class say that sucha being exists and exercises forethought, but only about great thingsand heavenly things, and about nothing on the earth; a fourth classsay that a divine being exercises forethought both about things onthe earth and heavenly things, but in a general way only, and notabout things severally. There is a fifth class to whom Ulysses andSocrates belong, who say: "I move not without thy knowledge."
</p>

<p>
Before all other things, then, it is necessary to inquire about eachof these opinions, whether it is affirmed truly or not truly. Forif there are no gods, how is it our proper end to follow them? Andif they exist, but take no care of anything, in this case also howwill it be right to follow them? But if indeed they do exist and lookafter things, still if there is nothing communicated from them tomen, nor in fact to myself, how even so is it right? The wise andgood man, then, after considering all these things, submits his ownmind to him who administers the whole, as good citizens do to thelaw of the state. He who is receiving instruction ought to come tothe instructed with this intention: How shall I follow the gods inall things, how shall I be contented with the divine administration,and how can I become free?" For he is free to whom everything happensaccording, to his will, and whom no man can hinder. "What then, isfreedom madness?" Certainly not: for madness and freedom do not consist."But," you say, "I would have everything result just as I like, andin whatever way I like." You are mad, you are beside yourself. Doyou not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing? But for meinconsiderately to wish for things to happen as I inconsideratelylike, this appears to be not only not noble, but even most base. Forhow do we proceed in the matter of writing? Do I wish to write thename of Dion as I choose? No, but I am taught to choose to write itas it ought to be written. And how with respect to music? In the samemanner. And what universally in every art or science? Just the same.If it were not so, it would be of no value to know anything, if knowledgewere adapted to every man's whim. Is it, then, in this alone, in thiswhich is the greatest and the chief thing, I mean freedom, that Iam permitted to will inconsiderately? By no means; but to be instructedis this, to learn to wish that everything may happen as it does. Andhow do things happen? As the disposer has disposed them? And he hasappointed summer and winter, and abundance and scarcity, and virtueand vice, and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole; andto each of us he has given a body, and parts of the body, and possessions,and companions. 
</p>

<p>
Remembering, then, this disposition of things we ought to go to beinstructed, not that we may change the constitution of things- forwe have not the power to do it, nor is it better that we should havethe power-but in order that, as the things around us are what theyare and by nature exist, we may maintain our minds in harmony withthem things which happen. For can we escape from men? and how is itpossible? And if we associate with them, can we chance them? Who givesus the power? What then remains, or what method is discovered of holdingcommerce with them? Is there such a method by which they shall dowhat seems fit to them, and we not the less shall be in a mood whichis conformable to nature? But you are unwilling to endure and arediscontented: and if you are alone, you call it solitude; and of youare with men, you call them knaves and robbers; and you find faultwith your own parents and children, and brothers and neighbours. Butyou ought when you are alone to call this condition by the name oftranquillity and freedom, and to think yourself like to the gods;and when you are with many, you ought not to call it crowd, nor trouble,nor uneasiness, but festival and assembly, and so accept all contentedly.
</p>

<p>
What, then, is the punishment of those who do not accept? It is tobe what they are. Is any person dissatisfied with being alone, lethim be alone. Is a man dissatisfied with his parents? let him be abad son, and lament. Is he dissatisfied with his children? let himbe a bad father. "Cast him into prison." What prison? Where he isalready, for he is there against his will; and where a man is againsthis will, there he is in prison. So Socrates was not in prison, forhe was there willingly. "Must my leg then be lamed?" Wretch, do youthen on account of one poor leg find fault with the world? Will younot willingly surrender it for the whole? Will you not withdraw fromit? Will you not gladly part with it to him who gave it? And willyou be vexed and discontented with the things established by Zeus,which he with the Moirae who were present and spinning the threadof your generation, defined and put in order? Know you not how smalla part you are compared with the whole. I mean with respect to thebody, for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods norless; for the magnitude of intelligence is not measured by lengthnor yet by height, but by thoughts. 
</p>

<p>
Will you not, then, choose to place your good in that in which youare equal to the gods? "Wretch that I am to have such a father andmother." What, then, was it permitted to you to come forth, and toselect, and to say: "Let such a man at this moment unite with sucha woman that I may be produced?" It was not permitted, but it wasa necessity for your parents to exist first, and then for you to bebegotten. Of what kind of parents? Of such as they were. Well then,since they are such as they are, is there no remedy given to you?Now if you did not know for what purpose you possess the faculty ofvision, you would be unfortunate and wretched if you closed your eyeswhen colors were brought before them; but in that you possess greatnessof soul and nobility of spirit for every event that may happen, andyou know not that you possess them, are you not more unfortunate andwretched? Things are brought close to you which are proportionateto the power which you possess, but you turn away this power mostparticularly at the very time when you ought to maintain it open anddiscerning. Do you not rather thank the gods that they have allowedyou to be above these things which they have not placed in your power;and have made you accountable only for those which are in your power?As to your parents, the gods have left you free from responsibility;and so with respect to your brothers, and your body, and possessions,and death and life. For what, then, have they made you responsible?For that which alone is in your power, the proper use of appearances.Why then do you draw on yourself the things for which you are notresponsible? It is, indeed, a giving of trouble to yourself.

How everything may he done acceptably to the gods 
</p>

<p>
When some one asked, how may a man eat acceptably to the gods, heanswered: If he can eat justly and contentedly, and with equanimity,and temperately and orderly, will it not be also acceptably to thegods? But when you have asked for warm water and the slave has notheard, or if he did hear has brought only tepid water, or he is noteven found to be in the house, then not to be vexed or to burst withpassion, is not this acceptable to the gods? "How then shall a manendure such persons as this slave?" Slave yourself, will you not bearwith your own brother, who has Zeus for his progenitor, and is likea son from the same seeds and of the same descent from above? Butif you have been put in any such higher place, will you immediatelymake yourself a tyrant? Will you not remember who you are, and whomyou rule? that they are kinsmen, that they are brethren by nature,that they are the offspring of Zeus? "But I have purchased them, andthey have not purchased me." Do you see in what direction you arelooking, that it is toward the earth, toward the pit, that it is towardthese wretched laws of dead men? but toward the laws of the gods youare not looking.

<p>
That the deity oversees all things 
</p>

<p>
When a person asked him how a man could be convinced that all hisactions are under the inspection of God, he answered, Do you not thinkthat all things are united in one? "I do," the person replied. Well,do you not think that earthly things have a natural agreement andunion with heavenly things "I do." And how else so regularly as ifby God's command, when He bids the plants to flower, do they flower?when He bids them to send forth shoots, do they shoot? when He bidsthem to produce fruit, how else do they produce fruit? when He bidsthe fruit to ripen, does it ripen? when again He bids them to castdown the fruits, how else do they cast them down? and when to shedthe leaves, do they shed the leaves? and when He bids them to foldthemselves up and to remain quiet and rest, how else do they remainquiet and rest? And how else at the growth and the wane of the moon,and at the approach and recession of the sun, are so great an alterationand change to the contrary seen in earthly things? But are plantsand our bodies so bound up and united with the whole, and are notour souls much more? and our souls so bound up and in contact withGod as parts of Him and portions of Him; and does not God perceiveevery motion of these parts as being His own motion connate with Himself?Now are you able to think of the divine administration, and aboutall things divine, and at the same time also about human affairs,and to be moved by ten thousand things at the same time in your sensesand in your understanding, and to assent to some, and to dissent fromothers, and again as to some things to suspend your judgment; anddo you retain in your soul so many impressions from so many and variousthings, and being moved by them, do you fall upon notions similarto those first impressed, and do you retain numerous arts and thememories of ten thousand things; and is not God able to oversee allthings, and to be present with all, and to receive from all a certaincommunication? And is the sun able to illuminate so large a part ofthe All, and to leave so little not illuminated, that part only whichis occupied by the earth's shadow; and He who made the sun itselfand makes it go round, being a small part of Himself compared withthe whole, cannot He perceive all things? 
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot," the man may reply, "comprehend all these things atonce." But who tells you that you have equal power with Zeus? Neverthelesshe has placed by every man a guardian, every man's Demon, to whomhe has committed the care of the man, a guardian who never sleeps,is never deceived. For to what better and more careful guardian couldHe have entrusted each of us? When, then, you have shut the doorsand made darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone,for you are not; but God is within, and your Demon is within, andwhat need have they of light to see what you are doing? To this Godyou ought to swear an oath just as the soldiers do to Caesar. Butthey who are hired for pay swear to regard the safety of Caesar beforeall things; and you who have received so many and such great favours,will you not swear, or when you have sworn, will you not abide byyour oath? And what shall you swear? Never to be disobedient, neverto make any charges, never to find fault with anything that he hasgiven, and never unwillingly to do or to suffer anything, that isnecessary. Is this oath like the soldier's oath? The soldiers swearnot to prefer any man to Caesar: in this oath men swear to honourthemselves before all.

What philosophy promises 
</p>

<p>
When a man was consulting him how he should persuade his brother tocease being angry with him, Epictetus replied: Philosophy does notpropose to secure for a man any external thing. If it did philosophywould be allowing something which is not within its province. Foras the carpenter's material is wood, and that of the statuary is copper,so the matter of the art of living is each man's life. "What thenis my brother's?" That again belongs to his own art; but with respectto yours, it is one of the external things, like a piece of land,like health, like reputation. But Philosophy promises none of these."In every circumstance I will maintain," she says, "the governingpart conformable to nature." Whose governing part? "His in whom Iam," she says. 
</p>

<p>
"How then shall my brother cease to be angry with me?" Bring him tome and I will tell him. But I have nothing to say to you about hisanger. 
</p>

<p>
When the man, who was consulting him, said, "I seek to know this-how, even if my brother is not reconciled to me, shall I maintainmyself in a state conformable to nature?" Nothing great, said Epictetus,is produced suddenly, since not even the grape or the fig is. If yousay to me now that you want a fig, I will answer to you that it requirestime: let it flower first, then put forth fruit, and then ripen. Is,then, the fruit of a fig-tree not perfected suddenly and in one hour,and would you possess the fruit of a man's mind in so short a timeand so easily? Do not expect it, even if I tell you.

<p>
Of providence 
</p>

<p>
Do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are providedfor the body, not only food and drink, but beds also, and they haveno need of shoes nor bed materials, nor clothing; but we require allthese additional things. For, animals not being made for themselves,but for service, it was not fit for them to he made so as to needother things. For consider what it would be for us to take care notonly of ourselves, but also about cattle and asses, how they shouldbe clothed, and how shod, and how they should eat and drink. Now assoldiers are ready for their commander, shod, clothed and armed: butit would be a hard thing, for the chiliarch to go round and shoe orclothe his thousand men; so also nature has formed the animals whichare made for service, all ready, prepared, and requiring no furthercare. So one little boy with only a stick drives the cattle.
</p>

<p>
But now we, instead of being thankful that we need not take the samecare of animals as of ourselves, complain of God on our own account;and yet, in the name of Zeus and the gods, any one thing of thosewhich exist would be enough to make a man perceive the providenceof God, at least a man who is modest and grateful. And speak not tome now of the great thins, but only of this, that milk is producedfrom grass, and cheese from milk, and wool from skins. Who made thesethings or devised them? "No one," you say. Oh, amazing shamelessnessand stupidity! 
</p>

<p>
Well, let us omit the works of nature and contemplate her smalleracts. Is there anything less useful than the hair on the chin? Whatthen, has not nature used this hair also in the most suitable mannerpossible? Has she not by it distinguished the male and the female?does not the nature of every man forthwith proclaim from a distance,"I am a man; as such approach me, as such speak to me; look for nothingelse; see the signs"? Again, in the case of women, as she has mingledsomething softer in the voice, so she has also deprived them of hair(on the chin). You say: "Not so; the human animal ought to have beenleft without marks of distinction, and each of us should have beenobliged to proclaim, 'I am a man.' But how is not the sign beautifuland becoming, and venerable? how much more beautiful than the cock'scomb, how much more becoming than the lion's mane? For this reasonwe ought to preserve the signs which God has given, we ought not tothrow them away, nor to confound, as much as we can, the distinctionsof the sexes. 
</p>

<p>
Are these the only works of providence in us? And what words are sufficientto praise them and set them forth according to their worth? For ifwe had understanding, ought we to do anything else both jointly andseverally than to sing hymns and bless the deity, and to tell of hisbenefits? Ought we not when we are digging and ploughing and eatingto sing this hymn to God? "Great is God, who has given us such implementswith which we shall cultivate the earth: great is God who has givenus hands, the power of swallowing, a stomach, imperceptible growth,and the power of breathing while we sleep." This is what we oughtto sing on every occasion, and to sing the greatest and most divinehymn for giving us the faculty of comprehending these things and usinga proper way. Well then, since most of you have become blind, oughtthere not to be some man to fill this office, and on behalf of allto sing the hymn to God? For what else can I do, a lame old man, thansing hymns to God? If then I was a nightingale, I would do the partof a nightingale: if I were a swan, I would do like a swan. But nowI am a rational creature, and I ought to praise God: this is my work;I do it, nor will I desert this post, so long as I am allowed to keepit; and I exhort you to join in this same song.

<p>
That the logical art is necessary 
</p>

<p>
Since reason is the faculty which analyses and perfects the rest,and it ought itself not to be unanalysed, by what should it be analysed?for it is plain that this should be done either by itself or by anotherthing. Either, then, this other thing also is reason, or somethingelse superior to reason; which is impossible. But if it is reason,again who shall analyse that reason? For if that reason does thisfor itself, our reason also can do it. But we shall require somethingelse, the thing, will go on to infinity and have no end. Reason thereforeis analysed by itself. "Yes: but it is more urgent to cure (our opinions)and the like." Will you then hear about those things? Hear. But ifyou should say, "I know not whether you are arguing truly or falsely,"and if I should express myself in any way ambiguously, and you shouldsay to me, " Distinguish," I will bear with you no longer, and I shallsay to "It is more urgent." This is the reason, I suppose, why theyplace the logical art first, as in the measuring of corn we placefirst the examination of the measure. But if we do not determine firstwhat is a modius, and what is a balance, how shall we be able to measureor weigh anything? 
</p>

<p>
In this case, then, if we have not fully learned and accurately examinedthe criterion of all other things, by which the other things are learned,shall we be able to examine accurately and to learn fully anythingelse? "Yes; but the modius is only wood, and a thing which producesno fruit." But it is a thing which can measure corn. "Logic also producesno fruit." As to this indeed we shall see: but then even if a manshould rant this, it is enough that logic has the power of distinguishingand examining other things, and, as we may say, of measuring and weighingthem. Who says this? Is it only Chrysippus, and Zeno, and Cleanthes?And does not Antisthenes say so? And who is it that has written thatthe examination of names is the beginning of education? And does notSocrates say so? And of whom does Xenophon write, that he began withthe examination of names, what each name signified? Is this then thegreat and wondrous thing to understand or interpret Chrysippus? Whosays this? What then is the wondrous thing? To understand the willof nature. Well then do you apprehend it yourself by your own power?and what more have you need of? For if it is true that all men errinvoluntarily, and you have learned the truth, of necessity you mustact right. "But in truth I do not apprehend the will of nature." Whothen tells us what it is? They say that it is Chrysippus. I proceed,and I inquire what this interpreter of nature says. I begin not tounderstand what he says; I seek an interpreter of Chrysippus. "Well,consider how this is said, just as if it were said in the Roman tongue."What then is this superciliousness of the interpreter? There is nosuperciliousness which can justly he charged even to Chrysippus, ifhe only interprets the will of nature, but does not follow it himself;and much more is this so with his interpreter. For we have no needof Chrysippus for his own sake, but in order that we may understandnature. Nor do we need a diviner on his own account, but because wethink that through him we shall know the future and understand thesigns given by the gods; nor do we need the viscera of animals fortheir own sake, but because through them signs are given; nor do welook with wonder on the crow or raven, but on God, who through themgives signs? 
</p>

<p>
I go then to the interpreter of these things and the sacrificer, andI say, "Inspect the viscera for me, and tell me what signs they give."The man takes the viscera, opens them, and interprets them: "Man,"he says, "you have a will free by nature from hindrance and compulsion;this is written here in the viscera. I will show you this first inthe matter of assent. Can any man hinder you from assenting to thetruth? No man can. Can any man compel you to receive what is false?No man can. You see that in this matter you have the faculty of thewill free from hindrance, free from compulsion, unimpeded." Well,then, in the matter of desire and pursuit of an object, is it otherwise?And what can overcome pursuit except another pursuit? And what canovercome desire and aversion except another desire and aversion? But,you object: "If you place before me the fear of death, you do compelme." No, it is not what is placed before you that compels, but youropinion that it is better to do so-and-so than to die. In this matter,then, it is your opinion that compelled you: that is, will compelledwill. For if God had made that part of Himself, which He took fromHimself and gave to us, of such a nature as to be hindered or compelledeither by Himself or by another, He would not then be God nor wouldHe be taking care of us as He ought. "This," says the diviner, "Ifind in the victims: these are the things which are signified to you.If you choose, you are free; if you choose, you will blame no one:you will charge no one. All will be at the same time according toyour mind and the mind of God." For the sake of this divination Igo to this diviner and to the philosopher, not admiring him for thisinterpretation, but admiring the things which he interprets.

<p>
That we ought not to he angry with the errors of others 
</p>

<p>
If what philosophers say is true, that all men have one principle,as in the case of assent the persuasion that a thing is so, and inthe case of dissent the persuasion that a thing is not so, and inthe case of a suspense of judgment the persuasion that a thing isuncertain, so also in the case of a movement toward anything the persuasionthat a thing is for a man's advantage, and it is impossible to thinkthat one thing is advantageous and to desire another, and to judgeone thing to be proper and to move toward another, why then are weangry with the many? "They are thieves and robbers," you may say.What do you mean by thieves and robbers? "They are mistaken aboutgood and evil." Ought we then to be angry with them, or to pity them?But show them their error, and you will see how they desist from theirerrors. If they do not see their errors, they have nothing superiorto their present opinion. 
</p>

<p>
"Ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroyed?" Byno means say so, but speak rather in this way: "This man who has beenmistaken and deceived about the most important things, and blinded,not in the faculty of vision which distinguishes white and black,but in the faculty which distinguishes good and bad, should we notdestroy him?" If you speak thus, you will see how inhuman this iswhich you say, and that it is just as if you would say, "Ought wenot to destroy this blind and deaf man?" But if the greatest harmis the privation of the greatest things, and the greatest thing inevery man is the will or choice such as it ought to be, and a manis deprived of this will, why are you also angry with him? Man, youought not to be affected contrary to nature by the bad things of another.Pity him rather: drop this readiness to be offended and to hate, andthese words which the many utter: "These accursed and odious fellows."How have you been made so wise at once? and how are you so peevish?Why then are we angry? Is it because we value so much the things ofwhich these men rob us? Do not admire your clothes, and then you willnot be angry with the thief. Do not admire the beauty of your wife,and you will not be angry with the adulterer. Learn that a thief andan adulterer have no place in the things which are yours, but in thosewhich belong to others and which are not in your power. If you dismissthese things and consider them as nothing, with whom are you stillangry? But so long as you value these things, be angry with yourselfrather than with the thief and the adulterer. Consider the matterthus: you have fine clothes; your neighbor has not: you have a window;you wish to air the clothes. The thief does not know wherein man'sgood consists, but he thinks that it consists in having fine clothes,the very thing which you also think. Must he not then come and takethem away? When you show a cake to greedy persons, and swallow itall yourself, do you expect them not to snatch it from you? Do notprovoke them: do not have a window: do not air your clothes. I alsolately had an iron lamp placed by the side of my household gods: hearinga noise at the door, I ran down, and found that the lamp had beencarried off. I reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done nothingstrange. What then? To-morrow, I said, you will find an earthen lamp:for a man only loses that which he has. "I have lost my garment."The reason is that you had a garment. "I have pain in my head." Haveyou any pain in your horns? Why then are you troubled? for we onlylose those things, we have only pains about those things which wepossess. 
</p>

<p>
"But the tyrant will chain." What? the leg. "He will take away." What?the neck. What then will he not chain and not take away? the will.This is why the ancients taught the maxim, "Know thyself." Thereforewe ought to exercise ourselves in small things and, beginning withthem, to proceed to the greater. "I have pain in the head." Do notsay, "Alas!" "I have pain in the ear." Do not say, "Alas!" And I donot say that you are not allowed to groan, but do not groan inwardly;and if your slave is slow in bringing a bandage, do not cry out andtorment yourself, and say, "Everybody hates me": for who would nothate such a man? For the future, relying on these opinions, walk aboutupright, free; not trusting to the size of your body, as an athlete,for a man ought not to be invincible in the way that an ass is.
</p>

<p>
Who then is the invincible? It is he whom none of the things disturbwhich are independent of the will. Then examining one circumstanceafter another I observe, as in the case of an athlete; he has comeoff victorious in the first contest: well then, as to the second?and what if there should be great heat? and what, if it should beat Olympia? And the same I say in this case: if you should throw moneyin his way, he will despise it. Well, suppose you put a young girlin his way, what then? and what, if it is in the dark? what if itshould be a little reputation, or abuse; and what, if it should bepraise; and what if it should be death? He is able to overcome all.What then if it be in heat, and what if it is in the rain, and whatif he be in a melancholy mood, and what if he be asleep? He will stillconquer. This is my invincible athlete. 
</p>

Chapter 19
</p>

<p>
How we should behave to tyrants 
</p>

<p>
If a man possesses any superiority, or thinks that he does, when hedoes not, such a man, if he is uninstructed, will of necessity bepuffed up through it. For instance, the tyrant says, "I am masterof all." And what can you do for me? Can you give me desire whichshall have no hindrance? How can you? Have you the infallible powerof avoiding what you would avoid? Have you the power of moving towardan object without error? And how do you possess this power? Come,when you are in a ship, do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman?And when you are in a chariot, to whom do you trust but to the driver?And how is it in all other arts? Just the same. In what then liesyour power? "All men pay respect to me." Well, I also pay respectto my platter, and I wash it and wipe it; and for the sake of my oilflask, I drive a peg into the wall. Well then, are these things superiorto me? No, but they supply some of my wants, and for this reason Itake care of them. Well, do I not attend to my ass? Do I not washhis feet? Do I not clean him? Do you not know that every man has regardto himself, and to you just the same as he has regard to his ass?For who has regard to you as a man? Show me. Who wishes to becomelike you? Who imitates you, as he imitates Socrates? "But I can cutoff your head." You say right. I had forgotten that I must have regardto you, as I would to a fever and the bile, and raise an altar toyou, as there is at Rome an altar to fever. 
</p>

<p>
What is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude? is it thetyrant and his guards? I hope that it is not so. It is not possiblethat what is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else, orhindered by any other thing than by itself. But it is a man's ownopinions which disturb him: for when the tyrant says to a man, "Iwill chain your leg," he who values his leg says, "Do not; have pity":but he who values his own will says, "If it appears more advantageousto you, chain it." "Do you not care?" I do not care. "I will showyou that I am master." You cannot do that. Zeus has set me free: doyou think that he intended to allow his own son to be enslaved? Butyou are master of my carcass: take it. "So when you approach me, youhave no regard to me?" No, but I have regard to myself; and if youwish me to say that I have regard to you also, I tell you that I havethe same regard to you that I have to my pipkin. 
</p>

<p>
This is not a perverse self-regard, for the animal is constitutedso as to do all things for itself. For even the sun does all thingsfor itself; nay, even Zeus himself. But when he chooses to be theGiver of rain and the Giver of fruits, and the Father of gods andmen, you see that he cannot obtain these functions and these names,if he is not useful to man; and, universally, he has made the natureof the rational animal such that it cannot obtain any one of its ownproper interests, if it does not contribute something to the commoninterest. In this manner and sense it is not unsociable for a manto do everything, for the sake of himself. For what do you expect?that a man should neglect himself and his own interest? And how inthat case can there be one and the same principle in all animals,the principle of attachment to themselves? 
</p>

<p>
What then? when absurd notions about things independent of our will,as if they were good and bad, lie at the bottom of our opinions, wemust of necessity pay regard to tyrants; for I wish that men wouldpay regard to tyrants only, and not also to the bedchamber men. Howis it that the man becomes all at once wise, when Caesar has madehim superintendent of the close stool? How is it that we say immediately,"Felicion spoke sensibly to me." I wish he were ejected from the bedchamber,that he might again appear to you to be a fool. 
</p>

<p>
Epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold because he was good fornothing. This fellow by some good luck was bought by one of Caesar'smen, and became Caesar's shoemaker. You should have seen what respectEpaphroditus paid to him: "How does the good Felicion do, I pray?"Then if any of us asked, "What is master doing?" the answer "He isconsulting about something with Felicion." Had he not sold the manas good for nothing? Who then made him wise all at once? This is aninstance of valuing something else than the things which depend onthe will. 
</p>

<p>
Has a man been exalted to the tribuneship? All who meet him offertheir congratulations; one kisses his eyes, another the neck, andthe slaves kiss his hands. He goes to his house, he finds torcheslighted. He ascends the Capitol: he offers a sacrifice of the occasion.Now who ever sacrificed for having had good desires? for having actedconformably to nature? For in fact we thank the gods for those thingsin which we place our good. 
</p>

<p>
A person was talking to me to-day about the priesthood of Augustus.I say to him: "Man, let the thing alone: you will spend much for nopurpose." But he replies, "Those who draw up agreements will writeany name." Do you then stand by those who read them, and say to suchpersons, "It is I whose name is written there;" And if you can nowbe present on all such occasions, what will you do when you are dead?"My name will remain." Write it on a stone, and it will remain. Butcome, what remembrance of you will there be beyond Nicopolis? "ButI shall wear a crown of gold." If you desire a crown at all, takea crown of roses and put it on, for it will be more elegant in appearance.

<p>
About reason, how it contemplates itself 
</p>

<p>
Every art and faculty contemplates certain things especially. Whenthen it is itself of the same kind with the objects which it contemplates,it must of necessity contemplate itself also: but when it is of anunlike kind, it cannot contemplate itself. For instance, the shoemaker'sart is employed on skins, but itself is entirely distinct from thematerial of skins: for this reason it does not contemplate itself.Again, the grammarian's art is employed about articulate speech; isthen the art also articulate speech? By no means. For this reasonit is not able to contemplate itself. Now reason, for what purposehas it been given by nature? For the right use of appearances. Whatis it then itself? A system of certain appearances. So by its natureit has the faculty of contemplating itself so. Again, sound sense,for the contemplation of what things does it belong to us? Good andevil, and things which are neither. What is it then itself? Good.And want of sense, what is it? Evil. Do you see then that good sensenecessarily contemplates both itself and the opposite? For this reasonit is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances,and to distinguish them, and to admit none without examination. Yousee even in the matter of coin, in which our interest appears to besomewhat concerned, how we have invented an art, and how many meansthe assayer uses to try the value of coin, the sight, the touch, thesmell, and lastly the hearing. He throws the coin down, and observesthe sound, and he is not content with its sounding once, but throughhis great attention he becomes a musician. In like manner, where wethink that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference,there we apply great attention to discovering the things which candeceive. But in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty, yawningand sleeping, we carelessly admit every appearance, for the harm isnot noticed. 
</p>

<p>
When then you would know how careless you are with respect to goodand evil, and how active with respect to things which are indifferent,observe how you feel with respect to being deprived of the sight ofeyes, and how with respect of being deceived, and you will discoveryou are far from feeling as you ought to in relation to good and evil."But this is a matter which requires much preparation, and much laborand study." Well then do you expect to acquire the greatest of artswith small labor? And yet the chief doctrine of philosophers is brief.If you would know, read Zeno's writings and you will see. For howfew words it requires to say man's end is to follow the god's, andthat the nature of good is a proper use of appearances. But if yousay "What is 'God,' what is 'appearance,' and what is 'particular'and what is 'universal nature'? then indeed many words are necessary.If then Epicures should come and say that the good must be in thebody; in this case also many words become necessary, and we must betaught what is the leading principle in us, and the fundamental andthe substantial; and as it is not probable that the good of a snailis in the shell, is it probable that the good of a man is in the body?But you yourself, Epicurus, possess something better than this. Whatis that in you which deliberates, what is that which examines everything,what is that which forms a judgement about the body itself, that itis the principle part? and why do you light your lamp and labor forus, and write so many books? is it that we may not be ignorant ofthe truth, who we are, and what we are with respect to you? Thus thediscussion requires many words.

Against those who wish to be admired 
</p>

When a man holds his proper station in life, he does not gape afterthings beyond it. Man, what do you wish to happen to you? "I am satisfiedif I desire and avoid conformably to nature, if I employ movementstoward and from an object as I am by nature formed to do, and purposeand design and assent." Why then do you strut before us as if youhad swallowed a spit? "My wish has always been that those who meetme should admire me, and those who follow me should exclaim, 'Oh,the great philosopher.'" Who are they by whom you wish to be admired?Are they not those of whom you are used to say that they are mad?Well then do you wish to be admired by madmen?

<p>
On precognitions 
</p>

<p>
Precognitions are common to all men, and precognition is not contradictoryto precognition. For who of us does not assume that Good is usefuland eligible, and in all circumstances that we ought to follow andpursue it? And who of us does not assume that justice is beautifuland becoming? When, then, does the contradiction arise? It arisesin the adaptation of the precognitions to the particular cases. Whenone man says, "He has done well: he is a brave man," and another says,"Not so; but he has acted foolishly"; then the disputes arise amongmen. This is the dispute among the Jews and the Syrians and the Egyptiansand the Romans; not whether holiness should be preferred to all thingsand in all cases should be pursued, but whether it is holy to eatpig's flesh or not holy. You will find this dispute also between Agamemnonand Achilles; for call them forth. What do you say, Agamemnon oughtnot that to be done which is proper and right? "Certainly." Well,what do you say, Achilles? do you not admit that what is good oughtto be done? "I do most certainly." Adapt your precognitions then tothe present matter. Here the dispute begins. Agamemnon says, "I oughtnot to give up Chryseis to her father." Achilles says, "You ought."It is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation of theprecognition of ought" or "duty." Further, Agamemnon says, "Then ifI ought to restore Chryseis, it is fit that I take his prize fromsome of you." Achilles replies, "Would you then take her whom I love?""Yes, her whom you love." "Must I then be the only man who goes withouta prize? and must I be the only man who has no prize?" Thus the disputebegins. 
</p>

<p>
What then is education? Education is the learning how to adapt thenatural precognitions to the particular things conformably to nature;and then to distinguish that of things some are in our power, butothers are not; in our power are will and all acts which depend onthe will; things not in our power are the body, the parts of the body,possessions, parents, brothers, children, country, and, generally,all with whom we live in society. In what, then, should we place thegood? To what kind of things shall we adapt it? "To the things whichare in our power?" Is not health then a good thing, and soundnessof limb, and life? and are not children and parents and country? Whowill tolerate you if you deny this? 
</p>

<p>
Let us then transfer the notion of good to these things. is it possible,then, when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things,that he can be happy? "It is not possible." And can he maintain towardsociety a proper behavior? He cannot. For I am naturally formed tolook after my own interest. If it is my interest to have an estatein land, it is my interest also to take it from my neighbor. If itis my interest to have a garment, it is my interest also to stealit from the bath. This is the origin of wars, civil commotions, tyrannies,conspiracies. And how shall I be still able to maintain my duty towardZeus? for if I sustain damage and am unlucky, he takes no care ofme; and what is he to me if he allows me to be in the condition inwhich I am? I now begin to hate him. Why, then, do we build temples,why set up statues to Zeus, as well as to evil demons, such as toFever; and how is Zeus the Saviour, and how the Giver of rain, andthe Giver of fruits? And in truth if we place the nature of Good inany such things, all this follows. 
</p>

<p>
What should we do then? This is the inquiry of the true philosopherwho is in labour. "Now I do not see what the Good is nor the Bad.Am I not mad? Yes." But suppose that I place the good somewhere amongthe things which depend on the will: all will laugh at me. There willcome some grey-head wearing many gold rings on his fingers and hewill shake his head and say, "Hear, my child. It is right that youshould philosophize; but you ought to have some brains also: all thisthat you are doing is silly. You learn the syllogism from philosophers;but you know how to act better than philosophers do." Man, why thendo you blame me, if I know? What shall I say to this slave? If I amsilent, he will burst. I must speak in this way: "Excuse me, as youwould excuse lovers: I am not my own master: I am mad."

Against Epicurus
</p>

<p>
    Even Epicurus perceives that we are by nature social, but having onceplaced our good in the husk he is no longer able to say anything else. For onthe other hand he strongly maintains this, that we ought not to admire nor toaccept anything which is detached from the nature of good; and he is right inmaintaining this. How then are we [suspicious], if we have no natural affectionto our children? Why do you advise the wise man not to bring up children? Whyare you afraid that he may thus fall into trouble? For does he fall intotrouble on account of the mouse which is nurtured in the house? What does hecare if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him? But Epicurusknows that if once a child is born, it is no longer in our power not to love itnor care about it. For this reason, Epicurus says that a man who has any sensealso does not engage in political matters; for he knows what a man must do whois engaged in such things; for, indeed, if you intend to behave among men asyou do among a swarm of flies, what hinders you? But Epicurus, who knows this,ventures to say that we should not bring up children. But a sheep does notdesert its own offspring, nor yet a wolf; and shall a man desert his child?What do you mean? that we should be as silly as sheep? but not even do theydesert their offspring: or as savage as wolves, but not even do wolves deserttheir young. Well, who would follow your advice, if he saw his child weepingafter falling on the ground? For my part I think that, even if your mother andyour father had been told by an oracle that you would say what you have said,they would not have cast you away.

<p>
How we should struggle with circumstances
</p>

<p>
    It is circumstances which show what men are. Therefore when a difficultyfalls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched youwith a rough young man. "For what purpose?" you may say, Why, that you maybecome an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat. In myopinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had, if youchoose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist. Weare now sending a scout to Rome; but no man sends a cowardly scout, who, if heonly hears a noise and sees a shadow anywhere, comes running back in terror andreports that the enemy is close at hand. So now if you should come and tell us,"Fearful is the state of affairs at Rome, terrible is death, terrible is exile;terrible is calumny; terrible is poverty; fly, my friends; the enemy is near";we shall answer, "Begone, prophesy for yourself; we have committed only onefault, that we sent such a scout."    Diogenes, who was sent as a scout before you, made a different report tous. He says that death is no evil, for neither is it base: he says that fame isthe noise of madmen. And what has this spy said about pain, about pleasure, andabout poverty? He says that to be naked is better than any purple robe, and tosleep on the bare ground is the softest bed; and he gives as a proof of eachthing that he affirms his own courage, his tranquillity his freedom, and thehealthy appearance and compactness of his body. "There is no enemy he says;"all is peace." How so, Diogenes? "See," he replies, "if I am struck, if I havebeen wounded, if I have fled from any man." This is what a scout ought to be.But you come to us and tell us one thing after another. Will you not go back,and you will see clearer when you have laid aside fear?    What then shall I do? What do you do when you leave a ship? Do you takeaway the helm or the oars? What then do you take away? You take what is yourown, your bottle and your wallet; and now if you think of what is your own, youwill never claim what belongs to others. The emperor says, "Lay aside yourlaticlave." See, I put on the angusticlave. "Lay aside this also." See, I haveonly my toga. "Lay aside your toga." See, I am naked. "But you still raise myenvy." Take then all my poor body; when, at a man's command, I can throw awaymy poor body, do I still fear him?    "But a certain person will not leave to me the succession to his estate."What then? had I forgotten that not one of these things was mine. How then dowe call them mine? just as we call the bed in the inn. If, then, the innkeeperat his death leaves you the beds, all well; but if he leaves them to another,he will have them, and you will seek another bed. If then you shall not findone, you will sleep on the ground: only sleep with a good will and snore, andremember that tragedies have their place among the rich and kings and tyrants,but no poor man fills a part in the tragedy, except as one of the chorus. Kingsindeed commence with prosperity: "ornament the palaces with garlands," thenabout the third or fourth act they call out, "O Cithaeron, why didst thoureceive me?" Slave, where are the crowns, where the diadem? The guards helpthee not at all. When then you approach any of these persons, remember thisthat you are approaching a tragedian, not the actor but OEdipus himself. Butyou say, "Such a man is happy; for he walks about with many," and I also placemyself with the many and walk about with many. In sum remember this: the dooris open; be not more timid than little children, but as they say, when thething does not please them, "I will play no loner," so do you, when things seemto you of such a kind, say I will no longer play, and begone: but if you stay,do not complain.

On the same
</p>

<p>
    If these things are true, and if we are not silly, and are not actinghypocritically when we say that the good of man is in the will, and the eviltoo, and that everything else does not concern us, why are we still disturbed,why are we still afraid? The things about which we have been busied are in noman's power: and the things which are in the power of others, we care not for.What kind of trouble have we still?    "But give me directions." Why should I give you directions? has not Zeusgiven you directions? Has he not given to you what is your own free fromhindrance and free from impediment, and what is not your own subject tohindrance and impediment? What directions then, what kind of orders did youbring when you came from him? Keep by every means what is your own; do notdesire what belongs to others. Fidelity is your own, virtuous shame is yourown; who then can take these things from you? who else than yourself willhinder you from using them? But how do you act? when you seek what is not yourown, you lose that which is your own. Having such promptings and commands fromZeus, what kind do you still ask from me? Am I more powerful than he, am I moreworthy of confidence? But if you observe these, do you want any others besides?"Well, but he has not given these orders" you will say. Produce yourprecognitions, produce the proofs of philosophers, produce what you have oftenheard, and produce what you have said yourself, produce what you have read,produce what you have meditated on (and you will then see that all these thingsare from God). How long, then, is it fit to observe these precepts from God,and not to break up the play? As long as the play is continued with propriety.In the Saturnalia a king is chosen by lot, for it has been the custom to playat this game. The king commands: "Do you drink," "Do you mix the wine," "Do yousing," "Do you go," "Do you come." I obey that the game may be broken upthrough me. But if he says, "Think that you are in evil plight": I answer, "Ido not think so"; and who compel me to think so? Further, we agreed to playAgamemnon and Achilles. He who is appointed to play Agamemnon says to me, "Goto Achilles and tear from him Briseis." I go. He says, "Come," and I come.    For as we behave in the matter of hypothetical arguments, so ought we to doin life. "Suppose it to be night." I suppose that it is night. "Well then; isit day?" No, for I admitted the hypothesis that it was night. "Suppose that youthink that it is night?" Suppose that I do. "But also think that it is night."That is not consistent with the hypothesis. So in this case also: "Suppose thatyou are unfortunate." Well, suppose so. "Are you then unhappy?" Yes. "Well,then, are you troubled with an unfavourable demon?" Yes. "But think also thatyou are in misery." This is not consistent with the hypothesis; and Anotherforbids me to think so.    How long then must we obey such orders? As long as it is profitable; andthis means as long as I maintain that which is becoming and consistent.Further, some men are sour and of bad temper, and they say, "I cannot sup withthis man to be obliged to hear him telling daily how he fought in Mysia: 'Itold you, brother, how I ascended the hill: then I began to be besiegedagain.'" But another says, "I prefer to get my supper and to hear him talk asmuch as he likes." And do you compare these estimates: only do nothing in adepressed mood, nor as one afflicted, nor as thinking that you are in misery,for no man compels you to that. Has it smoked in the chamber? If the smoke ismoderate, I will stay; if it is excessive, I go out: for you must alwaysremember this and hold it fast, that the door is open. Well, but you say to me,"Do not live in Nicopolis." I will not live there. "Nor in Athens." I will notlive in Athens. "Nor in Rome." I will not live in Rome. "Live in Gyarus." Iwill live in Gyarus, but it seems like a great smoke to live in Gyarus; and Idepart to the place where no man will hinder me from living, for thatdwelling-place is open to all; and as to the last garment, that is the poorbody, no one has any power over me beyond this. This was the reason whyDemetrius said to Nero, "You threaten me with death, but nature threatens you."If I set my admiration on the poor body, I have given myself up to be a slave:if on my little possessions, I also make myself a slave: for I immediately makeit plain with what I may be caught; as if the snake draws in his head, I tellyou to strike that part of him which he guards; and do you he assured thatwhatever part you choose to guard, that part your master will attack.Remembering this, whom will you still flatter or fear?    "But I should like to sit where the Senators sit." Do you see that you areputting yourself in straits, you are squeezing yourself. "How then shall I seewell in any other way in the amphitheatre?" Man, do not be a spectator at all;and you will not be squeezed. Why do you give yourself trouble? Or wait alittle, and when the spectacle is over, seat yourself in the place reserved forthe Senators and sun yourself. For remember this general truth, that it is wewho squeeze ourselves, who put ourselves in straits; that is, our opinionssqueeze us and put us in straits. For what is it to be reviled? Stand by astone and revile it; and what will you gain? If, then, a man listens like astone, what profit is there to the reviler? But if the reviler has as astepping-stone the weakness of him who is reviled, then he accomplishessomething. "Strip him." What do you mean by "him"? Lay hold of his garment,strip it off. "I have insulted you." Much good may it do you.    This was the practice of Socrates: this was the reason why he always hadone face. But we choose to practice and study anything rather than the means bywhich we shall be unimpeded and free. You say, "Philosophers talk paradoxes."But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? and what is more paradoxical thanto puncture a man's eye in order that he may see? If any one said this to a manignorant of the surgical art, would he not ridicule the speaker? Where is thewonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxicalto the inexperienced?

<p>
In how many ways appearances exist, and what aids we should provide against                                     them
</p>

<p>
    Appearances to us in four ways: for either things appear as they are; orthey are not, and do not even appear to be; or they are, and do not appear tobe; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Further, in all these cases to forma right judgement is the office of an educated man. But whatever it is thatannoys us, to that we ought to apply a remedy. If the sophisms of Pyrrho and ofthe Academics are what annoys, we must apply the remedy to them. If it is thepersuasion of appearances, by which some things appear to be good, when theyare not good, let us seek a remedy for this. If it is habit which annoys us, wemust try to seek aid against habit. What aid then can we find against habit,The contrary habit. You hear the ignorant say: "That unfortunate person isdead: his father and mother are overpowered with sorrow; he was cut off by anuntimely death and in a foreign land." Here the contrary way of speaking: tearyourself from these expressions: oppose to one habit the contrary habit; tosophistry oppose reason, and the exercise and discipline of reason; againstpersuasive appearances we ought to have manifest precognitions, cleared of allimpurities and ready to hand.    When death appears an evil, we ought to have this rule in readiness, thatit is fit to avoid evil things, and that death is a necessary thing. For whatshall I do, and where shall I escape it? Suppose that I am not Sarpedon, theson of Zeus, nor able to speak in this noble way: "I will go and I am resolvedeither to behave bravely myself or to give to another the opportunity of doingso; if I cannot succeed in doing anything myself, I will not grudge another thedoing of something noble." Suppose that it is above our power to act thus; isit not in our power to reason thus? Tell me where I can escape death: discoverfor me the country, show me the men to whom I must go, whom death does notvisit. Discover to me a charm against death. If I have not one, what do youwish me to do? I cannot escape from death. Shall I not escape from the fear ofdeath, but shall I die lamenting and trembling? For the origin of perturbationis this, to wish for something, and that this should not happen. Therefore if Iam able to change externals according to my wish, I change them; but if Icannot, I am ready to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me. For the natureof man is not to endure to be deprived of the good, and not to endure thefalling into the evil. Then, at last, when I am neither able to changecircumstances nor to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me, I sit down andgroan, and abuse whom I can, Zeus and the rest of the gods. For if they do notcare for me, what are they to me? "Yes, but you will be an impious man." Inwhat respect then will it be worse for me than it is now? To sum up, rememberthis that unless piety and your interest be in the same thing, piety cannot bemaintained in any man. Do not these things seem necessary?    Let the followers of Pyrrho and the Academics come and make theirobjections. For I, as to my part, have no leisure for these disputes, nor am Iable to undertake the defense of common consent. If I had a suit even about abit of land, I would call in another to defend my interests. With what evidencethen am I satisfied? With that which belongs to the matter in hand. How indeedperception is effected, whether through the whole body or any part, perhaps Icannot explain: for both opinions perplex me. But that you and I are not thesame, I know with perfect certainty. "How do you know it?" When I intend toswallow anything, I never carry it to your b month, but to my own. When Iintend to take bread, I never lay hold of a broom, but I always go to the breadas to a mark. And you yourselves who take away the evidence of the senses, doyou act otherwise? Who among you, when he intended to enter a bath, ever wentinto a mill?    What then? Ought we not with all our power to hold to this also, themaintaining of general opinion, and fortifying ourselves against the argumentswhich are directed against it? Who denies that we ought to do this? Well, heshould do it who is able, who has leisure for it; but as to him who tremblesand is perturbed and is inwardly broken in heart, he must employ his timebetter on something else.

That we ought not to he angry with men; and what are the small and the great                               things among men
</p>

<p>
    What is the cause of assenting to anything? The fact that it appears to betrue. It is not possible then to assent to that which appears not to be true.Why? Because this is the nature of the understanding, to incline to the true,to be dissatisfied with the false, and in matters uncertain to withhold assent.What is the proof of this? "Imagine, if you can, that it is now night." It isnot possible. "Take away your persuasion that it is day." It is not possible."Persuade yourself or take away your persuasion that the stars are even innumber." It is impossible. When, then, any man assents to that which is false,be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as false, for every soul isunwillingly deprived of the truth, as Plato says; but the falsity seemed to himto be true. Well, in acts what have we of the like kind as we have here truthor falsehood? We have the fit and the not fit, the profitable and theunprofitable, that which is suitable to a person and that which is not, andwhatever is like these. Can, then, a man think that a thing is useful to himand not choose it? He cannot. How says Medea?       "'Tis true I know what evil I shall do,       But passion overpowers the better council.'"She thought that to indulge her passion and take vengeance on her husband wasmore profitable than to spare her children. "It was so; but she was deceived."Show her plainly that she is deceived, and she will not do it; but so long asyou do not show it, what can she follow except that which appears to herself?Nothing else. Why, then, are you angry with the unhappy woman that she has beenbewildered about the most important things, and is become a viper instead of ahuman creature? And why not, if it is possible, rather pity, as we pity theblind and the lame, those who are blinded and maimed in the faculties which aresupreme?    Whoever, then, clearly remembers this, that to man the measure of every actis the appearance- whether the thing appears good or bad: if good, he is freefrom blame; if bad, himself suffers the penalty, for it is impossible that hewho is deceived can be one person, and he who suffers another person- whoeverremembers this will not be angry with any man, will not be vexed at any man,will not revile or blame any man, nor hate nor quarrel with any man.    "So then all these great and dreadful deeds have this origin, in theappearance?" Yes, this origin and no other. The Iliad is nothing else thanappearance and the use of appearances. It appeared to Paris to carry off thewife of Menelaus: it appeared to Helen to follow him. If then it had appearedto Menelaus to feel that it was a gain to be deprived of such a wife, whatwould have happened? Not only a wi would the Iliad have been lost, but theOdyssey also. "On so small a matter then did such great things depend?" Butwhat do you mean by such great things? Wars and civil commotions, and thedestruction of many men and cities. And what great matter is this? "Is itnothing?" But what great matter is the death of many oxen, and many sheep, andmany nests of swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed? "Are these things,then, like those?" Very like. Bodies of men are destroyed, and the bodies ofoxen and sheep; the dwellings of men are burnt, and the nests of storks. Whatis there in this great or dreadful? Or show me what is the difference between aman's house and a stork's nest, as far as each is a dwelling; except that manbuilds his little houses of beams and tiles and bricks, and the stork buildsthem of sticks and mud. "Are a stork and a man, then, like things?" What sayyou? In body they are very much alike.    "Does a man then differ in no respect from a stork?" Don't suppose that Isay so; but there is no difference in these matters. "In what, then, is thedifference?" Seek and you will find that there is a difference in anothermatter. See whether it is not in a man the understanding of what he does, seeif it is not in social community, in fidelity, in modesty, in steadfastness, inintelligence. Where then is the great good and evil in men? It is where thedifference is. If the difference is preserved and remains fenced round, andneither modesty is destroyed, nor fidelity, nor intelligence, then the man alsois preserved; but if any of these things is destroyed and stormed like a city,then the man too perishes; and in this consist the great things. Paris, yousay, sustained great damage, then, when the Hellenes invaded and when theyravaged Troy, and when his brothers perished. By no means; for no man isdamaged by an action which is not his own; but what happened at that time wasonly the destruction of storks' nests: now the ruin of Paris was when he lostthe character of modesty, fidelity, regard to hospitality, and to decency. Whenwas Achilles ruined? Was it when Patroclus died? Not so. But it happened whenhe began to be angry, when he wept for a girl, when he forgot that he was atTroy not to get mistresses, but to fight. These things are the ruin of men,this is being besieged, this is the destruction of cities, when right opinionsare destroyed, when they are corrupted.    "When, then, women are carried off, when children are made captives, andwhen the men are killed, are these not evils?" How is it then that you add tothe facts these opinions? Explain this to me also. "I shall not do that; buthow is it that you say that these are not evils?" Let us come to the rules:produce the precognitions: for it is because this is neglected that we cannotsufficiently wonder at what men do. When we intend to judge of weights, we donot judge by guess: where we intend to judge of straight and crooked, we do notjudge by guess. In all cases where it is our interest to know what is true inany matter, never will any man among us do anything by guess. But in thingswhich depend on the first and on the only cause of doing right or wrong, ofhappiness or unhappiness, of being unfortunate or fortunate, there only we areinconsiderate and rash. There is then nothing like scales, nothing like a rule:but some appearance is presented, and straightway I act according to it. Must Ithen suppose that I am superior to Achilles or Agamemnon, so that they byfollowing appearances do and suffer so many evils: and shall not the appearancebe sufficient for me? And what tragedy has any other beginning? The Atreus ofEuripides, what is it? An appearance. The OEdipus of Sophocles, what is it? Anappearance. The Phoenix? An appearance. The Hippolytus? An appearance. Whatkind of a man then do you suppose him to be who pays no regard to this matter?And what is the name of those who follow every appearance? "They are calledmadmen." Do we then act at all differently?

On constancy
</p>

<p>
    The being of the Good is a certain Will; the being of the Bad is a certainkind of Will. What then are externals? Materials for the Will, about which thewill being conversant shall obtain its own good or evil. How shall it obtainthe good? If it does not admire the materials; for the opinions about thematerials, if the opinions are right, make the will good: but perverse anddistorted opinions make the will bad. God has fixed this law, and says, "If youwould have anything good, receive it from yourself." You say, "No, but I haveit from another." Do not so: but receive it from yourself. Therefore when thetyrant threatens and calls me, I say, "Whom do you threaten If he says, "I willput you in chains," I say, "You threaten my hands and my feet." If he says, "Iwill cut off your head," I reply, "You threaten my head." If he says, "I willthrow you into prison," I say, "You threaten the whole of this poor body." Ifhe threatens me with banishment, I say the same. "Does he, then, not threatenyou at all?" If I feel that all these things do not concern me, he does notthreaten me at all; but if I fear any of them, it is I whom he threatens. Whomthen do I fear? the master of what? The master of things which are in my ownpower? There is no such master. Do I fear the master of things which are not inmy power? And what are these things to me?    "Do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings?" I hope not. Who amongus teaches to claim against them the power over things which they possess? Takemy poor body, take my property, take my reputation, take those who are aboutme. If I advise any persons to claim these things, they may truly accuse me."Yes, but I intend to command your opinions also." And who has given you thispower? How can you conquer the opinion of another man? "By applying terror toit," he replies, "I will conquer it." Do you not know that opinion conquersitself, and is not conquered by another? But nothing else can conquer Willexcept the Will itself. For this reason, too, the law of God is most powerfuland most just, which is this: "Let the stronger always be superior to theweaker." "Ten are stronger than one." For what? For putting in chains, forkilling, for dragging whither they choose, for taking away what a man has. Theten therefore conquer the one in this in which they are stronger. "In what thenare the ten weaker," If the one possess right opinions and the others do not."Well then, can the ten conquer in this matter?" How is it possible? If we wereplaced in the scales, must not the heavier draw down the scale in which it is?    "How strange, then, that Socrates should have been so treated by theAthenians." Slave, why do you say Socrates? Speak of the thing as it is: howstrange that the poor body of Socrates should have been carried off and draggedto prison by stronger men, and that any one should have given hemlock to thepoor body of Socrates, and that it should breathe out the life. Do these thingsseem strange. do they seem unjust, do you on account of these things blame God?Had Socrates then no equivalent for these things, Where, then, for him was thenature of good? Whom shall we listen to, you or him? And what does Socratessay? "Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot hurt me": and further, hesays, "If it so pleases God, so let it be."    But show me that he who has the inferior principles overpowers him who issuperior in principles. You will never show this, nor come near showing it; forthis is the law of nature and of God that the superior shall always overpowerthe inferior. In what? In that in which it is superior. One body is strongerthan another: many are stronger than one: the thief is stronger than he who isnot a thief. This is the reason why I also lost my lamp, because in wakefulnessthe thief was superior to me. But the man bought the lamp at this price: for alamp he became a thief, a faithless fellow, and like a wild beast. This seemedto him a good bargain. Be it so. But a man has seized me by the cloak, and isdrawing me to the public place: then others bawl out, "Philosopher, what hasbeen the use of your opinions? see you are dragged to prison, you are going tobe beheaded." And what system of philosophy could f have made so that, if astronger man should have laid hold of my cloak, I should not be dragged off;that if ten men should have laid hold of me and cast me into prison, I shouldnot be cast in? Have I learned nothing else then? I have learned to see thateverything which happens, if it be independent of my will, is nothing to me. Imay ask if you have not gained by this. Why then do you seek advantage inanything else than in that in which you have learned that advantage is?    Then sitting in prison I say: "The man who cries out in this way neitherhears what words mean, nor understands what is said, nor does he care at all toknow what philosophers say or what they do. Let him alone."    But now he says to the prisoner, "Come out from your prison." If you haveno further need of me in prison, I come out: if you should have need of meagain, I will enter the prison. "How long will you act thus?" So long as reasonrequires me to be with the body: but when reason does not require this, takeaway the body, and fare you well. Only we must not do it inconsiderately, norweakly, nor for any slight reason; for, on the other hand, God does not wish itto be done, and he has need of such a world and such inhabitants in it. But ifhe sounds the signal for retreat, as he did to Socrates, we must obey him whogives the signal, as if he were a general.    "Well, then, ought we to say such things to the many?" Why should we? Is itnot enough for a man to be persuaded himself? When children come clapping theirhands and crying out, "To-day is the good Saturnalia," do we say, "TheSaturnalia are not good?" By no means, but we clap our hands also. Do you alsothen, when you are not able to make a man change his mind, be assured that heis a child, and clap your hands with him, and if you do not choose to do this,keep silent.    A man must keep this in mind; and when he is called to any such difficulty,he should know that the time is come for showing if he has been instructed. Forhe who is come into a difficulty is like a young man from a school who haspracticed the resolution of syllogisms; and if any person proposes to him aneasy syllogism, he says, "Rather propose to me a syllogism which is skillfullycomplicated that I may exercise myself on it." Even athletes are dissatisfiedwith slight young men, and say "He cannot lift me." "This is a youth of nobledisposition." But when the time of trial is come, one of you must weep and say,"I wish that I had learned more." A little more of what? If you did not learnthese things in order to show them in practice, why did you learn them? I thinkthat there is some one among you who are sitting here, who is suffering like awoman in labour, and saying, "Oh, that such a difficulty does not presentitself to me as that which has come to this man; oh, that I should be wastingmy life in a corner, when I might be crowned at Olympia. When will any oneannounce to me such a contest?" Such ought to be the disposition of all of you.Even among the gladiators of Caesar there are some who complain grievously thatthey are not brought forward and matched, and they offer up prayers to God andaddress themselves to their superintendents entreating that they might fight.And will no one among you show himself such? I would willingly take a voyagefor this purpose and see what my athlete is doing, how he is studying hissubject. "I do not choose such a subject," he says. Why, is it in your power totake what subject you choose? There has been given to you such a body as youhave, such parents, such brethren, such a country, such a place in yourcountry: then you come to me and say, "Change my subject." Have you notabilities which enable you to manage the subject which has been given to you?"It is your business to propose; it is mine to exercise myself well." However,you do not say so, but you say, "Do not propose to me such a tropic, but such:do not urge against me such an objection, but such." There will be a time,perhaps, when tragic actors will suppose that they are masks and buskins andthe long cloak. I say, these things, man, are your material and subject. Uttersomething that we may know whether you are a tragic actor or a buffoon; forboth of you have all the rest in common. If any one then should take away thetragic actor's buskins and his mask, and introduce him on the stage as aphantom, is the tragic actor lost, or does he still remain? If he has voice, hestill remains.    An example of another kind. "Assume the governorship of a province." Iassume it, and when I have assumed it, I show how an instructed man behaves."Lay aside the laticlave and, clothing yourself in rags, come forward in thischaracter." What then have I not the power of displaying a good voice? How,then, do you now appear? As a witness summoned by God. "Come forward, you, andbear testimony for me, for you are worthy to be brought forward as a witness byme: is anything external to the will good or bad? do I hurt any man? have Imade every man's interest dependent on any man except himself?" What testimonydo you give for God? "I am in a wretched condition, Master, and I amunfortunate; no man cares for me, no man gives me anything; all blame me, allspeak ill of me." Is this the evidence that you are going to give, and disgracehis summons, who has conferred so much honour on you, and thought you worthy ofbeing called to bear such testimony?    But suppose that he who has the power has declared, "I judge you to beimpious and profane." What has happened to you? "I have been judged to beimpious and profane?" Nothing else? "Nothing else." But if the same person hadpassed judgment on an hypothetical syllogism, and had made a declaration, "theconclusion that, if it is day, it is light, I declare to be false," what hashappened to the hypothetical syllogism? who is judged in this case? who hasbeen condemned? the hypothetical syllogism, or the man who has been deceived byit? Does he, then, who has the power of making any declaration about you knowwhat is pious or impious? Has he studied it, and has he learned it? Where? Fromwhom? Then is it the fact that a musician pays no regard to him who declaresthat the lowest chord in the lyre is the highest; nor yet a geometrician, if hedeclares that the lines from the centre of a circle to the circumference arenot equal; and shall he who is really instructed pay any regard to theuninstructed man when he pronounces judgment on what is pious and what isimpious, on what is just and unjust? Oh, the signal wrong done by theinstructed. Did they learn this here?    Will you not leave the small arguments about these matters to others, tolazy fellows, that they may sit in a corner and receive their sorry pay, orgrumble that no one gives them anything; and will you not come forward and makeuse of what you have learned? For it is not these small arguments that arewanted now: the writings of the Stoics are full of them. What then is the thingwhich is wanted? A man who shall apply them, one who by his acts shall beartestimony to his words. Assume, I, entreat you, this character, that we may nolonger use in the schools the examples of the ancients but may have someexample of our own.    To whom then does the contemplation of these matters belong? To him who hasleisure, for man is an animal that loves contemplation. But it is shameful tocontemplate these things as runaway slaves do; we should sit, as in a theatre,free from distraction, and listen at one time to the tragic actor, at anothertime to the lute-player; and not do as slaves do. As soon as the slave hastaken his station he praises the actor and at the same time looks round: thenif any one calls out his master's name, the slave is immediately frightened anddisturbed. It is shameful for philosophers thus to contemplate the works ofnature. For what is a master? Man is not the master of man; but death is, andlife and pleasure and pain; for if he comes without these things, bring Caesarto me and you will see how firm I am. But when he shall come with these things,thundering and lightning, and when I am afraid of them, what do I do thenexcept to recognize my master like the runaway slave? But so long as I have anyrespite from these terrors, as a runaway slave stands in the theatre, so do I:I bathe, I drink, I sing; but all this I do with terror and uneasiness. But ifI shall release myself from my masters, that is from those things by means ofwhich masters are formidable, what further trouble have I, what master have Istill?    "What then, ought we to publish these things to all men?" No, but we oughtto accommodate ourselves to the ignorant and to say: "This man recommends to methat which he thinks good for himself: I excuse him." For Socrates also excusedthe gaoler, who had the charge of him in prison and was weeping when Socrateswas going to drink the poison, and said, "How generously he laments over us."Does he then say to the gaoler that for this reason we have sent away thewomen? No, but he says it to his friends who were able to hear it; and hetreats the gaoler as a child.

What we ought to have ready in difficult circumstances
</p>

<p>
    When you are going into any great personage, remember that Another alsofrom above sees what is going on, and that you ought to please Him rather thanthe other. He, then, who sees from above asks you: "In the schools what usedyou to say about exile and bonds and death and disgrace?" I used to say thatthey are things indifferent. "What then do you say of them now? Are theychanged at all?" No. "Are you changed then?" No. "Tell me then what things areindifferent?" The things which are independent of the will. "Tell me, also,what follows from this." The things which are independent of the will arenothing to me. "Tell me also about the Good, what was your opinion?" A willsuch as we ought to have and also such a use of appearances. "And the end, whatis it?" To follow Thee. "Do you say this now also?" I say the same now also.    Then go into the great personage boldly and remember these things; and youwill see what a youth is who has studied these things when he is among men whohave not studied them. I indeed imagine that you will have such thoughts asthese: "Why do we make so great and so many preparations for nothing? Is thisthe thing which men name power? Is this the antechamber? this the men of thebedchamber? this the armed guards? Is it for this that I listened to so manydiscourses? All this is nothing: but I have been preparing myself for somethinggreat."

<p>
Chapter 1
</p>

<p>
That confidence is not inconsistent with caution
</p>

<p>
    The opinion of the philosophers, perhaps, seems to some to be a paradox;but still let us examine as well as we can, if it is true that it is possibleto do everything both with caution and with confidence. For caution seems to bein a manner contrary to confidence, and contraries are in no way consistent.That which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under consideration inmy opinion is of this kind: if we asserted that we ought to employ caution andin the same things, men might justly accuse us of bringing together thingswhich cannot be united. But now where is the difficulty in what is said? for ifthese things are true, which have been often said and often proved, that thenature of good is in the use of appearances, and the nature of evil likewise,and that things independent of our will do not admit either the nature of evilnor of good, what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that wherethings are not dependent on the will, there you should employ confidence, butwhere they are dependent on the will, there you should employ caution? For ifthe bad consists in a bad exercise of the will, caution ought only to be usedwhere things are dependent on the will. But if things independent of the willand not in our power are nothing to us, with respect to these we must employconfidence; and thus we shall both be cautious and confident, and indeedconfident because of our caution. For by employing caution toward things whichare really bad, it will result that we shall have confidence with respect tothings which are not so.    We are then in the condition of deer; when they flee from the huntsmen'sfeathers in fright, whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge assafe? They turn to the nets, and thus they perish by confounding things whichare objects of fear with things that they ought not to fear. Thus we also act:in what cases do we fear? In things which are independent of the will. In whatcases, on the contrary, do we behave with confidence, as if there were nodanger? In things dependent on the will. To be deceived then, or to act rashly,or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something, does not concern us atall, if we only hit the mark in things which are independent of our will. Butwhere there is death, or exile or pain or infamy, there we attempt or examineto run away, there we are struck with terror. Therefore, as we may expect it tohappen with those who err in the greatest matters, we convert naturalconfidence into audacity, desperation, rashness, shamelessness; and we convertnatural caution and modesty into cowardice and meanness, which are full of fearand confusion. For if a man should transfer caution to those things in whichthe will may be exercised and the acts of the will, he will immediately, bywilling to be cautious, have also the power of avoiding what he chooses: but ifhe transfer it to the things which are not in his power and will, and attemptto avoid the things which are in the power of others, he will of necessityfear, he will be unstable, he will be disturbed. For death or pain is notformidable, but the fear of pain or death. For this reason we commend the poetwho said       Not death is evil, but a shameful death.Confidence then ought to be employed against death, and caution against thefear of death. But now we do the contrary, and employ against death the attemptto escape; and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness, rashness andindifference. These things Socrates properly used to call "tragic masks"; foras to children masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience, we also areaffected in like manner by events for no other reason than children are bymasks. For what is a child? Ignorance. What is a child? Want of knowledge. Forwhen a child knows these things, he is in no way inferior to us. What is death?A "tragic mask." Turn it and examine it. See, it does not bite. The poor bodymust be separated from the spirit either now or later, as it was separated fromit before. Why, then, are you troubled, if it be separated now? for if it isnot separated now, it will be separated afterward. Why? That the period of theuniverse may be completed, for it has need of the present, and of the future,and of the past. What is pain? A mask. Turn it and examine it. The poor fleshis moved roughly, then, on the contrary, smoothly. If this does not satisfyyou, the door is open: if it does, bear. For the door ought to be open for alloccasions; and so we have no trouble.    What then is the fruit of these opinions? It is that which ought to he themost noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated, release fromperturbation, release from fear, freedom. For in these matters we must notbelieve the many, who say that free persons only ought to be educated, but weshould rather believe the philosophers, who say that the educated only arefree. "How is this?" In this manner. Is freedom anything else than the power ofliving as we choose? "Nothing else." Tell me then, ye men, do you wish to livein error? "We do not." No one then who lives in error is free. Do you wish tolive in fear? Do you wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live inperturbation? "By no means." No one, then, who is in a state of fear or sorrowor perturbation is free; but whoever is delivered from sorrows and fears andperturbations, he is at the same time also delivered from servitude. How thencan we continue to believe you, most dear legislators, when you say, "We onlyallow free persons to be educated?" For philosophers say we allow none to befree except the educated; that is, God does not allow it. "When then a man hasturned round before the praetor his own slave, has he done nothing?" He hasdone something. "What?" He has turned round his own slave before the praetor."Has he done nothing, more?" Yes: he is also bound to pay for him the taxcalled the twentieth. "Well then, is not the man who has gone through thisceremony become free?" No more than he is become free from perturbations. Haveyou who are able to turn round others no master? is not money your master, or agirl or a boy, or some tyrant, or some friend of the tyrant? why do you tremblethen when you are going off to any trial of this kind? It is for this reasonthat I often say: Study and hold in readiness these principles by which you maydetermine what those things are with reference to which you ought to haveconfidence, and those things with reference to which you ought to be cautious:courageous in that which does not depend on your will; cautious in that whichdoes depend on it.    "Well have I not read to you, and do you not know what I was doing?" Inwhat? "In my little dissertations." Show me how you are with respect to desireand aversion; and show if you do not fail in getting what you wish, me and ifyou do not fall into the things which you would avoid: but as to these long andlaboured sentences, you will take them and blot them out.    "What then did not Socrates write?" And who wrote so much? But how? As hecould not always have at hand one to argue against his principles or to beargued against in turn, he used to argue with and examine himself, and he wasalways treating at least some one subject in a practical way. These are thethings which a philosopher writes. But little dissertations and that method,which I speak of, he leaves to others, to the stupid, or to those happy men whobeing free from perturbations have leisure, or to such as are too foolish toreckon consequences.    And will you now, when the opportunity invites, go and display those thingswhich you possess, and recite them, and make an idle show, and say, "See how Imake dialogues?" Do not so, my man: but rather say: "See how I am notdisappointed of that which I desire. See how I do not fall into that which Iwould avoid. Set death before me, and you will see. Set before me pain, prison,disgrace and condemnation." This is the proper display of a young man who iscome out of the schools. But leave the rest to others, and let no one ever hearyou say a word about these things; and if any man commends you for them, do notallow it; but think that you are nobody and know nothing. Only show that youknow this, how never to be disappointed in your desire and how never to fallinto that which you would avoid. Let others labour at forensic causes, problemsand syllogisms: do you labour at thinking about death, chains, the rack, exile;and do all this with confidence and reliance on him who has called you to thesesufferings, who has judged you worthy of the place in which, being stationed,you will show what things the rational governing power can do when it takes itsstand against the forces which are not within the power of our will. And thusthis paradox will no longer appear either impossible or a paradox, that a manought to be at the same time cautious and courageous: courageous toward thethings which do not depend on the will, and cautious in things which are withinthe power of the will.

<p>
Of Tranquillity
</p>

<p>
    Consider, you who are going into court, what you wish to maintain and whatyou wish to succeed in. For if you wish to maintain a will conformable tonature, you have every security, every facility, you have no troubles. For ifyou wish to maintain what is in your own power and is naturally free, and ifyou are content with these, what else do you care for? For who is the master ofsuch things? Who can take them away? If you choose to be modest and faithful,who shall not allow you to be so? If you choose not to be restrained orcompelled, who shall compel you to desire what you think that you ought not todesire? who shall compel you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid? Butwhat do you say? The judge will determine against you something that appearsformidable; but that you should also suffer in trying to avoid it, how can hedo that? When then the pursuit of objects and the avoiding of them are in yourpower, what else do you care for? Let this be your preface, this yournarrative, this your confirmation, this your victory, this your peroration,this your applause.    Therefore Socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare for histrial, "Do you not think then that I have been preparing for it all my life?"By what kind of preparation? "I have maintained that which was in my ownpower." How then? "I have never done anything unjust either in my private or inmy public life."    But if you wish to maintain externals also, your poor body, your littleproperty and your little estimation, I advise you to make from this moment allpossible preparation, and then consider both the nature of your judge and youradversary. If it is necessary to embrace his knees, embrace his knees; if toweep, weep; if to groan, groan. For when you have subjected to externals whatis your own, then be a slave and do not resist, and do not sometimes choose tobe a slave, and sometimes not choose, but with all your mind be one or theother, either free or a slave, either instructed or uninstructed, either awell-bred cock or a mean one, either endure to be beaten until you die or yieldat once; and let it not happen to you to receive many stripes and then toyield. But if these things are base, determine immediately: "Where is thenature of evil and good? It is where truth is: where truth is and where natureis, there is caution: where truth is, there is courage where nature is."    For what do you think? do you think that, if Socrates had wished topreserve externals, he would have come forward and said: "Anytus and Meletuscan certainly kill me, but to harm me they are not able?" Was he so foolish asnot to see that this way leads not to the preservation of life and fortune, butto another end? What is the reason then that he takes no account of hisadversaries, and even irritates them? Just in the same way my friendHeraclitus, who had a little suit in Rhodes about a bit of land, and had provedto the judges that his case was just, said, when he had come to the perorationof his speech, "I will neither entreat you nor do I care what judgment you willgive, and it is you rather than I who are on your trial." And thus he ended thebusiness. What need was there of this? Only do not entreat; but do not alsosay, "I. do not entreat"; unless there is a fit occasion to irritate purposelythe judges, as was the case with Socrates. And you, if you are preparing such aperoration, why do you wait, why do you obey the order to submit to trial? Forif you wish to be crucified, wait and the cross will come: but if you choose tosubmit and to plead your cause as well as you can, you must do what isconsistent with this object, provided you maintain what is your own.    For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, "Suggest something to me."What should I suggest to you? "Well, form my mind so as to accommodate itselfto any event." Why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of lettersshould say, "Tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me." For if Ishould tell him to write Dion, and then another should come and propose to himnot the name of Dion but that of Theon, what will be done? what will he write?But if you behave practiced writing, you are also prepared to write anythingthat is required. If you are not, what. can I now suggest? For if circumstancesrequire something else, what will you say or what will you do? Remember, then,this general precept and you will need no suggestion. But if you gape afterexternals, you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will ofyour master. And who is the master? He who has the power over the things whichyou seek to gain or try to avoid.

To those who recommend persons to philosophers
</p>

<p>
    Diogenes said well to one who asked from him letters of recommendation,"That you are a man he said, "he will know as soon as he sees you; and he willknow whether you are good or bad, if he is by experience skillful todistinguish the good and the bad; but if he is without experience, he willnever know, if I write to him ten thousand times." For it is just the same asif a drachma asked to be recommended to a person to be tested. If he isskillful in testing silver, he will know what you are, for you will recommendyourself. We ought then in life also to have some skill as in the case ofsilver coin that a man may be able to say, like the judge of silver, "Bring meany drachma and I will test it." But in the case of syllogisms I would say,"Bring any man that you please, and I will distinguish for you the man whoknows how to resolve syllogisms and the man who does not." Why? Because I knowhow to resolve syllogisms. I have the power, which a man must have who is ableto discover those who have the power of resolving syllogisms. But in life howdo I act? At one time I call a thing good, and at another time bad. What is thereason? The contrary to that which is in the case of syllogisms, ignorance andinexperience.

<p>
Against a person who had once been detected in adultery
</p>

<p>
    As Epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity, and that he whosubverts fidelity subverts the peculiar characteristic of men, there enteredone of those who are considered to be men of letters, who had once beendetected in adultery in the city. Then Epictetus continued: But if we lay asidethis fidelity for which we are formed and make designs against our neighbor'swife, what are we are we doing? What else but destroying and overthrowing?Whom? The man of fidelity, the man of modesty, the man of sanctity. Is thisall? And are we not overthrowing neighbourhood, and friendship, and thecommunity; and in what place are we putting ourselves? How shall I consideryou, man? As a neighbour, as a friend? What kind of one? As a citizen? Whereinshall I trust you? So if you were an utensil so worthless that a man could notuse you, you would be pitched out on the dung heaps, and no man would pick youup. But if, being a man, you are unable to fill any place which befits a man,what shall we do with you? For suppose that you cannot hold the place of afriend, can you hold the place of a slave? And who will trust you? Are you notthen content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap, as auseless utensil, and a bit of dung? Then will you say, "No man, cares for me, aman of letters"? They do not, because you are bad and useless. It is just as ifthe wasps complained because no man cares for them, but all fly from them, andif a man can, he strikes them and knocks them down. You have such a sting thatyou throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound with it. What would youhave us do with you? You have no place where you can be put.    "What then, are not women common by nature?" So I say also; for a littlepig is common to all the invited guests, but when the portions have beendistributed, go, if you think it right, and snatch up the portion of him whoreclines next to you, or slyly steal it, or place your hand down by it and layhold of it, and if you cannot tear away a bit of the meat, grease your fingersand lick them. A fine companion over cups, and Socratic guest indeed! "Well, isnot the theatre common to the citizens?" When then they have taken their seats,come, if you think proper, and eject one of them. In this way women also arecommon by nature. When, then, the legislator, like the master of a feast, hasdistributed them, will you not also look for your own portion and not filch andhandle what belongs to another. "But I am a man of letters and understandArchedemus." Understand Archedemus then, and be an adulterer, and faithless,and instead of a man, be a wolf or an ape: for what is the difference?

Chapter 5
</p>

<p>
How magnanimity is consistent with care
</p>

<p>
    Things themselves are indifferent; but the use of them is not indifferent.How then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity, and at the same timebe careful and neither rash nor negligent? If he imitates those who play atdice. The counters are indifferent; the dice are indifferent. How do I knowwhat the cast will be? But to use carefully and dexterously the cast of thedice, this is my business. Thus in life also the chief business is this:distinguish and separate things, and say, "Externals are not in my power: willis in my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the thingswhich are my own." But in what does not belong to you call nothing either goodor bad, or profit or damage or anything of the kind.    "What then? Should we use such things carelessly?" In no way: for this onthe other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently againstnature; but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent and weshould also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because thematerial is indifferent. For where the material is not indifferent, there noman can hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and compelled theobtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad; but theuse is either bad or good, and the use is in my power. But it is difficult tomingle and to bring together these two things, the carefulness of him who isaffected by the matter and the firmness of him who has no regard for it; but itis not impossible; and if it is, happiness is impossible. But we should act aswe do in the case of a voyage. What can I do? I can choose the master of theship, the sailors, the day, the opportunity. Then comes a storm. What more haveI to care for? for my part is done. The business belongs to another- themaster. But the ship is sinking- what then have I to do? I do the only thingsthat I can, not to be drowned full of fear, nor screaming, nor blaming God, butknowing that what has been produced must also perish: for I am not an immortalbeing, but a man, a part of the whole, as an hour is a part of the day: I mustbe present like the hour, and past like the hour. What difference, then, doesit make to me how I pass away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for Imust pass through some such means?    This is just what you will see those doing who play at ball skillfully. Noone cares about the ball being good or bad, but about throwing and catching it.In this therefore is the skill, this the art, the quickness, the judgement, sothat if I spread out my lap I may not be able to catch it, and another, if Ithrow, may catch the ball. But if with perturbation and fear we receive orthrow the ball, what kind of play is it then, and wherein shall a man besteady, and how shall a man see the order in the game? But one will say,"Throw"; or, "Do not throw"; and another will say, "You have thrown once." Thisis quarreling, not play.    Socrates, then, knew how to play at ball. How?" By using pleasantry in thecourt where he was tried. "Tell me," he says, "Anytus, how do you say that I donot believe in God. The Demons, who are they, think you? Are they not sons ofGods, or compounded of gods and men?" When Anytus admitted this, Socrates said,"Who then, think you, can believe that there are mules, but not asses"; andthis he said as if he were playing at ball. And what was the ball in that case?Life, chains, banishment, a draught of poison, separation from wife and leavingchildren orphans. These were the things with which he was playing; but still hedid play and threw the ball skillfully. So we should do: we must employ all thecare of the players, but show the same indifference about the ball. For weought by all means to apply our art to some external material, not as valuingthe material, but, whatever it may be, showing our art in it. Thus too theweaver does not make wool, but exercises his art upon such as he receives.Another gives you food and property and is able to take them away and your poorbody also. When then you have received the material, work on it. If then youcome out without having suffered anything, all who meet you will congratulateyou on your escape; but he who knows how to look at such things, if he shallsee that you have behaved properly in the matter, will commend you and bepleased with you; and if he shall find that you owe your escape to any want ofproper behavior, he will do the contrary. For where rejoicing is reasonable,there also is congratulation reasonable.    How then is it said that some external things are according to nature andothers contrary to nature? It is said as it might be said if we were separatedfrom union: for to the foot I shall say that it is according to nature for itto be clean; but if you take it as a foot and as a thing not detached, it willbefit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns, and sometimes to be cutoff for the benefit of the whole body; otherwise it is no longer a foot. Weshould think in some way about ourselves also. What are you? A man. If youconsider yourself as detached from other men, it is according to nature to liveto old age, to be rich, to be healthy. But if you consider yourself as a manand a part of a certain whole, it is for the sake of that whole that at onetime you should be sick, at another time take a voyage and run into danger, andat another time be in want, and, in some cases, die prematurely. Why then areyou troubled? Do you not know, that as a foot is no longer a foot if it isdetached from the body, so you are no longer a man if you are separated fromother men. For what is a man? A part of a state, of that first which consistsof Gods and of men; then of that which is called next to it, which is a smallimage of the universal state. "What then must I be brought to trial; mustanother have a fever, another sail on the sea, another die, and another becondemned?" Yes, for it is impossible in such a body, in such a universe ofthings, among so many living together, that such things should not happen, someto one and others to others. It is your duty then, since you are come here, tosay what you ought, to arrange these things as it is fit. Then some one says,"I shall charge you with doing me wrong." Much good may it do you: I have donemy part; but whether you also have done yours, you must look to that; for thereis some danger of this too, that it may escape your notice.

<p>
Of indifference
</p>

<p>
    The hypothetical proposition is indifferent: the judgment about it is notindifferent, but it is either knowledge or opinion or error. Thus life isindifferent: the use is not indifferent. When any man then tells you that thesethings also are indifferent, do not become negligent; and when a man invitesyou to be careful, do not become abject and struck with admiration of materialthings. And it is good for you to know your own preparation and power, that inthose matters where you have not been prepared, you may keep quiet, and not bevexed, if others have the advantage over you. For you, too, in syllogisms willclaim to have the advantage over them; and if others should be vexed at this,you will console them by saying, "I have learned them, and you have not." Thusalso where there is need of any practice, seek not that which is required fromthe need, but yield in that matter to those who have had practice, and beyourself content with firmness of mind.    Go and salute a certain person. "How?" Not meanly. "But I have been shutout, for I have not learned to make my way through the window; and when I havefound the door shut, I must either come back or enter through the window." Butstill speak to him. "In what way?" Not meanly. But suppose that you have notgot what you wanted. Was this your business, and not his? Why then do you claimthat which belongs to another? Always remember what is your own, and whatbelongs to another; and you will not be disturbed. Chrysippus therefore saidwell, "So long as future things are uncertain, I always cling to those whichare more adapted to the conservation of that which is according to nature; forGod himself has given me the faculty of such choice." But if I knew that it wasfated for me to be sick, I would even move toward it; for the foot also, if ithad intelligence, would move to go into the mud. For why are ears of cornproduced? Is it not that they may become dry? And do they not become dry thatthey may be reaped? for they are not separated from communion with otherthings. If then they had perception, ought they to wish never to be reaped? Butthis is a curse upon ears of corn, never to be reaped. So we must know that inthe case of men too it is a curse not to die, just the same as not to beripened and not to be reaped. But since we must be reaped, and we also knowthat we are reaped, we are vexed at it; for we neither know what we are norhave we studied what belongs to man, as those who have studied horses know whatbelongs to horses. But Chrysantas, when he was going to strike the enemy,checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat: so it seemedbetter to him to obey the general's command than to follow his own inclination.But not one of us chooses, even when necessity summons, readily to obey it, butweeping and groaning we suffer what we do suffer, and we call them"circumstances." What kind of circumstances, man? If you give the name ofcircumstances to the things which are around you, all things are circumstances;but if you call hardships by this name, what hardship is there in the dying ofthat which has been produced? But that which destroys is either a sword, or awheel, or the sea, or a tile, or a tyrant. Why do you care about the way ofgoing down to Hades? All ways are equal. But if you will listen to the truth,the way which the tyrant sends you is shorter. A tyrant never killed a man insix months: but a fever is often a year about it. All these things are onlysound and the noise of empty names.    "I am in danger of my life from Caesar." And am not I in danger who dwellin Nicopolis, where there are so many earthquakes: and when you are crossingthe Hadriatic, what hazard do you run? Is it not the hazard of your life? "ButI am in danger also as to opinion." Do you mean your own? how? For who cancompel you to have any opinion which you do not choose? But is it as to anotherman's opinion? and what kind of danger is yours, if others have false opinions?"But I am in danger of being banished." What is it to be banished? To besomewhere else than at Rome? "Yes: what then if I should be sent to Gyara?" Ifthat suits you, you will go there; but if it does not, you can go to anotherplace instead of Gyara, whither he also will go, who sends you to Gyara,whether he choose or not. Why then do you go up to Rome as if it were somethinggreat? It is not worth all this preparation, that an ingenuous youth shouldsay, "It was not worth while to have heard so much and to have written so muchand to have sat so long by the side of an old man who is not worth much." Onlyremember that division by which your own and not your own are distinguished:never claim anything which belongs to others. A tribunal and a prison are eacha place, one high and the other low; but the will can be maintained equal, ifyou choose to maintain it equal in each. And we shall then be imitators ofSocrates, when we are able to write paeans in prison. But in our presentdisposition, consider if we could endure in prison another person saying to us."Would you like me to read Paeans to you?" "Why do you trouble me? do you notknow the evils which hold me? Can I in such circumstances?" What circumstances?"I am going to die." And will other men be immortal?

How we ought to use divination
</p>

<p>
    Through an unreasonable regard to divination many of us omit many duties.For what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease, generallythings of that kind? If then I must expose myself to danger for a friend, andif it is my duty even to die for him, what need have I then for divination?Have I not within me a diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil,and has explained to me the signs of both? What need have I then to consult theviscera of victims or the flight of birds, and why do I submit when he says,"It is for your interest"? For does he know what is for my interest, does heknow what is good; and as he has learned the signs of the viscera, has he alsolearned the signs of good and evil? For if he knows the signs of these, heknows the signs both of the beautiful and of the ugly, and of the just and ofthe unjust. Do you tell me, man, what is the thing which is signified for me:is it life or death, poverty or wealth? But whether these things are for myinterest or whether they are not, I do not intend to ask you. Why don't yougive your opinion on matters of grammar, and why do you give it here aboutthings on which we are all in error and disputing with one another? The woman,therefore, who intended to send by a vessel a month's provisions to Gratilla inher banishment, made a good answer to him who said that Domitian would seizewhat she sent. "I would rather," she replied, "that Domitian should seize allthan that I should not send it."    What then leads us to frequent use of divination? Cowardice, the dread ofwhat will happen. This is the reason why we flatter the diviners. "Pray,master, shall I succeed to the property of my father?" "Let us see: let ussacrifice on the occasion." "Yes, master, as fortune chooses." When he hassaid, "You shall succeed to the inheritance," we thank him as if we receivedthe inheritance from him. The consequence is that they play upon us.    What then should we do? We ought to come without desire or aversion, as thewayfarer asks of the man whom he meets which of two roads leads (to hisjourney's end), without any desire for that which leads to the right ratherthan to the left, for he has no wish to go by any road except the road whichleads (to his end). In the same way ought we to come to God also as a guide; aswe use our eyes, not asking them to show us rather such things as we wish, butreceiving the appearances of things such as the eyes present them to us. Butnow we trembling take the augur by the hand, and, while we invoke God, weentreat the augur, and say, "Master have mercy on me; suffer me to come safeout of this difficulty." Wretch would you have, then, anything other than whatis best? Is there then anything better than what pleases God? Why do you, sofar as in your power, corrupt your judge and lead astray your adviser?

<p>
What is the nature of the good
</p>

<p>
    God is beneficial. But the Good also is beneficial. It is consistent thenthat where the nature of God is, there also the nature of the good should be.What then is the nature of God? Flesh? Certainly not. An estate in land? By nomeans. Fame? No. Is it intelligence, knowledge, right reason? Yes. Herein thensimply seek the nature of the good; for I suppose that you do not seek it in aplant. No. Do you seek it in an irrational animal? No. If then you seek it in arational animal, why do you still seek it anywhere except in the superiority ofrational over irrational animals? Now plants have not even the power of usingappearances, and for this reason you do not apply the term good to them. Thegood then requires the use of appearances. Does it require this use only? Forif you say that it requires this use only, say that the good, and thathappiness and unhappiness are in irrational animals also. But you do not saythis, and you do right; for if they possess even in the highest degree the useof appearances, yet they have not the faculty of understanding the use ofappearances; and there is good reason for this, for they exist for the purposeof serving others, and they exercise no superiority. For the ass, I suppose,does not exist for any superiority over others. No; but because we had need ofa back which is able to bear something; and in truth we had need also of hisbeing able to walk, and for this reason he received also the faculty of makinguse of appearances, for otherwise he would not have been able to walk. And herethen the matter stopped. For if he had also received the faculty ofcomprehending the use of appearances, it is plain that consistently with reasonhe would not then have been subjected to us, nor would he have done us theseservices, but he would have been equal to us and like to us.    Will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal? for if itis not there, you not choose to say that it exists in any other thing. "Whatthen? are not plants and animals also the works of God?" They are; but they arenot superior things, nor yet parts of the Gods. But you are a superior thing;you are a portion separated from the deity; you have in yourself a certainportion of him. Why then are you ignorant of your own noble descent? Why do younot know whence you came? will you not remember when you are eating, who youare who eat and whom you feed? When you are in conjunction with a woman, willyou not remember who you are who do this thing? When you are in socialintercourse, when you are exercising yourself, when you are engaged indiscussion, know you not that you are nourishing a god, that you are exercisinga god? Wretch, you are carrying about a god with you, and you know it not. Doyou think that I mean some God of silver or of gold, and external? You carryhim within yourself, and you perceive not that you are polluting him by impurethoughts and dirty deeds. And if an image of God were present, you would notdare to do any of the things which you are doing: but when God himself ispresent within and sees all and hears all, you are not ashamed of thinking suchthings and doing such things, ignorant as you are of your own nature andsubject to the anger of God. Then why do we fear when we are sending a youngman from the school into active life, lest he should do anything improperly,eat improperly, have improper intercourse with women; and lest the rags inwhich he is wrapped should debase him, lest fine garments should make himproud? This youth does not know his own God: he knows not with whom he setsout. But can we endure when he says, "I wish I had you with me." Have you notGod with you? and do you seek for any other, when you have him? or will Godtell you anything else than this? If you were a statue of Phidias, eitherAthena or Zeus you would think broth of yourself and of the artist, and if youhad any understanding you would try to do nothing unworthy of him who made youor of yourself, and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress to those who lookon you. But now because Zeus has made you, for this reason do you care not howyou shall appear? And yet is the artist like the artist in the other? or thework in the one case like the other? And what work of an artist, for instance,has in itself the faculties, which the artist shows in making it? Is it notmarble or bronze, or gold or ivory? and the Athena of Phidias when she has onceextended the hand and received in it the figure of Victory stands in thatattitude forever. But the works of God have power of motion, they breathe, theyhave the faculty of using the appearances of things, and the power of examiningthem. Being the work of such an artist, do you dishonor him? And what shall Isay, not only that he made you, but also intrusted you to yourself and made youa deposit to yourself? Will you not think of this too, but do you also dishonoryour guardianship? But if God had intrusted an orphan to you, would you thusneglect him? He has delivered yourself to your care, and says, "I had no onefitter to intrust him to than yourself: keep him for me such as he is bynature, modest, faithful, erect, unterrified, free from passion andperturbation." And then you do not keep him such.    But some will say, "Whence has this fellow got the arrogance which hedisplays and these supercilious looks?" I have not yet so much gravity asbefits a philosopher; for I do not yet feel confidence in what I have learnedand what I have assented to: I still fear my own weakness. Let me getconfidence and the, you shall see a countenance such as I ought to have and anattitude such as I ought to have: then I will show to you the statue, when itis perfected, when it is polished. What do you expect? a superciliouscountenance? Does the Zeus at Olympia lift up his brow? No, his look is fixedas becomes him who is ready to say       Irrevocable is my word and shall not fail.Such will I show myself to you, faithful, modest, noble, free fromperturbation. "What, and immortal too, exempt from old age, and from sickness?"No, but dying as becomes a god, sickening as becomes a god. This power Ipossess; this I can do. But the rest I do not possess, nor can I do. I willshow the nerves of a philosopher. "What nerves are these?" A desire neverdisappointed, an aversion which never falls on that which it would avoid, aproper pursuit, a diligent purpose, an assent which is not rash. These youshall see.

Chapter 9
</p>

<p>
That when we cannot fulfill that which the character of a man promises, we                     assume the character of a philosopher
</p>

<p>
    It is no common thing to do this only, to fulfill the promise of a man'snature. For what is a man? The answer is: "A rational and mortal being." Then,by the rational faculty, from whom are we separated? From wild beasts. And fromwhat others? From sheep and like animals. Take care then to do nothing like awild beast; but if you do, you have lost the character of a man; you have notfulfilled your promise. See that you do nothing like a sheep; but if you do, inthis case the man is lost. What then do we do as sheep? When we actgluttonously, when we act lewdly, when we act rashly, filthily,inconsiderately, to what have we declined? To sheep. What have we lost? Therational faculty. When we act contentiously and harmfully and passionately, andviolently, to what have we declined? To wild beasts. Consequently some of usare great wild beasts, and others little beasts, of a bad disposition andsmall, whence we may say, "Let me be eaten by a lion." But in all these waysthe promise of a man acting as a man is destroyed. For when is a conjunctiveproposition maintained? When it fulfills what its nature promises; so that thepreservation of a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths.When is a disjunctive maintained? When it fulfills what it promises. When areflutes, a lyre, a horse, a dog, preserved? What is the wonder then if man alsoin like manner is preserved, and in like manner is lost? Each man is improvedand preserved by corresponding acts, the carpenter by acts of carpentry, thegrammarian by acts of grammar. But if a man accustoms himself to writeungrammatically, of necessity his art will be corrupted and destroyed. Thusmodest actions preserve the modest man, and immodest actions destroy him: andactions of fidelity preserve the faithful man, and the contrary actions destroyhim. And on the other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary characters:shamelessness strengthens the shameless man, faithlessness the faithless man,abusive words the abusive man, anger the man of an angry temper, and unequalreceiving and giving make the avaricious man more avaricious.    For this reason philosophers admonish us not to be satisfied with learningonly, but also to add study, and then practice. For we have long beenaccustomed to do contrary things, and we put in practice opinions which arecontrary to true opinions. If then we shall not also put in practice rightopinions, we shall be nothing more than the expositors of the opinions ofothers. For now who among us is not able to discuss according to the rules ofart about good and evil things? "That of things some are good, and some arebad, and some are indifferent: the good then are virtues, and the things whichparticipate in virtues; and the are the contrary; and the indifferent arewealth, health, reputation." Then, if in the midst of our talk there shouldhappen some greater noise than usual, or some of those who are present shouldlaugh at us, we are disturbed. Philosopher, where are the things which you weretalking about? Whence did you produce and utter them? From the lips, and thenceonly. Why then do you corrupt the aids provided by others? Why do you treat theweightiest matters as if you were playing a game of dice? For it is one thingto lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse, and another thing to eat. Thatwhich has been eaten, is digested, distributed, and is become sinews, flesh,bones, blood, healthy colour, healthy breath. Whatever is stored up, when youchoose you can readily take and show it; but you have no other advantage fromit except so far as to appear to possess it. For what is the difference betweenexplaining these doctrines and those of men who have different opinions? Sitdown now and explain according to the rules of art the opinions of Epicurus,and perhaps you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner than Epicurushimself. Why then do you call yourself a Stoic? Why do you deceive the many?Why do you deceive the many? Why do you act the part of a Jew, when you are aGreek? Do you not see how each is called a Jew, or a Syrian or an Egyptian? andwhen we see a man inclining to two sides, we are accustomed to say, "This manis not a Jew, but he acts as one." But when he has assumed the affects of onewho has been imbued with Jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect, then he isin fact and he is named a Jew. Thus we too being falsely imbued, are in nameJews, but in fact we are something else. Our affects are inconsistent with ourwords; we are far from practicing what we say, and that of which we are proud,as if we knew it. Thus being, unable to fulfill even what the character of aman promises, we even add to it the profession of a philosopher, which is asheavy a burden, as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should attempt toraise the stone which Ajax lifted.

Chapter 10

<p>
How we may discover the duties of life from names
</p>

<p>
    Consider who you are. In the first place, you are a man; and this is onewho has nothing superior to the faculty of the will, but all other thingssubjected to it; and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free fromsubjection. Consider then from what things you have been separated by reason.You have been separated from wild beasts: you have been separated from domesticanimals. Further, you are a citizen of the world, and a part of it, not one ofthe subservient, but one of the principal parts, for you are capable ofcomprehending the divine administration and of considering the connection ofthings. What then does the character of a citizen promise? To hold nothing asprofitable to himself; to deliberate about nothing as if he were detached fromthe community, but to act as the hand or foot would do, if they had reason andunderstood the constitution of nature, for they would never put themselves inmotion nor desire anything, otherwise than with reference to the whole.Therefore the philosophers say well, that if the good man had foreknowledge ofwhat would happen, he would cooperate toward his own sickness and death andmutilation, since he knows that these things are assigned to him according tothe universal arrangement, and that the whole is superior to the part and thestate to the citizen. But now, because we do not know the future, it is ourduty to stick to the things which are in their nature more suitable for ourchoice, for we were made among other things for this.    After this, remember that you are a son. What does this character promise?To consider that everything which is the son's belongs to the father, to obeyhim in all things, never to blame him to another, nor to say or do anythingwhich does him injury, to yield to him in all things and give way, cooperatingwith him as far as you can. After this know that you are a brother also, andthat to this character it is due to make concessions; to be easily persuaded,to speak good of your brother, never to claim in opposition to him any of thethings which are independent of the will, but readily to give them up, that youmay have the larger share in what is dependent on the will. For see what athing it is, in place of a lettuce, if it should so happen, or a seat, to gainfor yourself goodness of disposition. How great is the advantage.    Next to this, if you are senator of any state, remember that you are asenator: if a youth, that you are a youth: if an old man, that you are an oldman; for each of such names, if it comes to be examined, marks out the properduties. But if you go and blame your brother, I say to you, "You have forgottenwho you are and what is your name." In the next place, if you were a smith andmade a wrong use of the hammer, you would have forgotten the smith; and if youhave forgotten the brother and instead of a brother have become an enemy, wouldyou appear not to have changed one thing for another in that case? And ifinstead of a man, who is a tame animal and social, you are become a mischievouswild beast, treacherous, and biting, have you lost nothing? But, you must losea bit of money that you may suffer damage? And does the loss of nothing else doa man damage? If you had lost the art of grammar or music, would you think theloss of it a damage? and if you shall lose modesty, moderation and gentleness,do you think the loss nothing? And yet the things first mentioned are lost bysome cause external and independent of the will, and the second by our ownfault; and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is shameful;but as to the second, not to have them and to lose them is shameful and matterof reproach and a misfortune. What does the pathic lose? He loses the man. Whatdoes he lose who makes the pathic what he is? Many other things; and he alsoloses the man no less than the other. What does he lose who commits adultery?He loses the modest, the temperate, the decent, the citizen, the neighbour.What does he lose who is angry? Something else. What does the coward lose?Something else. No man is bad without suffering some loss and damage. If thenyou look for the damage in the loss of money only, all these men receive noharm or damage; it may be, they have even profit and gain, when they acquire abit of money by any of these deeds. But consider that if you refer everythingto a small coin, not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged."Yes," you say, "for he is mutilated in his body." Well; but does he who haslost his smell only lose nothing? Is there, then, no energy of the soul whichis an advantage to him who possesses it, and a damage to him who has lost it?"Tell me what sort you mean." Have we not a natural modesty? "We have." Does hewho loses this sustain no damage? is he deprived of nothing, does he part withnothing of the things which belong to him? Have we not naturally fidelity?natural affection, a natural disposition to help others, a natural dispositionto forbearance? The man then who allows himself to be damaged in these matters,can he be free from harm and uninjured? "What then? shall I not hurt him, whohas hurt me?" In the first place consider what hurt is, and remember what youhave heard from the philosophers. For if the good consists in the will, and theevil also in the will, see if what you say is not this: "What then, since thatman has hurt himself by doing an unjust act to me, shall I not hurt myself bydoing some unjust act to him?" Why do we not imagine to something of this kind?But where there is any detriment to the body or to our possession, there isharm there; and where the same thing happens to the faculty of the will, thereis no harm; for he who has been deceived or he who has done an unjust actneither suffers in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip, nor does he lose hisestate; and we wish for nothing else than these things. But whether we shallhave the will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless, we care not theleast, except only in the school so far as a few words are concerned. Thereforeour proficiency is limited to these few words; but beyond them it does notexist even in the slightest degree.

Chapter 11
</p>

<p>
What the beginning of philosophy is
</p>

<p>
    The beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in the rightway and by the door, is a consciousness of his own weakness and inability aboutnecessary things. For we come into the world with no natural notion of aright-angled triangle, or of a diesis, or of a half tone; but we learn each ofthese things by a certain transmission according to art; and for this reasonthose who do not know them, do not think that they know them. But as to goodand evil, and beautiful and ugly, and becoming and unbecoming, and happinessand misfortune, and proper and improper, and what we ought to do and what weought not to do, whoever came into the world without having an innate idea ofthem? Wherefore we all use these names, and we endeavor to fit thepreconceptions to the several cases thus: "He has done well, he has not donewell; he has done as he ought, not as he ought; he has been unfortunate, he hasbeen fortunate; he is unjust, he is just": who does not use these names? whoamong us defers the use of them till he has learned them, as he defers the useof the words about lines or sounds? And the cause of this is that we come intothe world already taught as it were by nature some things on this matter, andproceeding from these we have added to them self-conceit. "For why," a mansays, "do I not know the beautiful and the ugly? Have I not the notion of it?"You have. "Do I not adapt it to particulars?" You do. "Do I not then adapt itproperly?" In that lies the whole question; and conceit is added here. For,beginning from these things which are admitted, men proceed to that which ismatter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation; for if they possessed thispower of adaptation in addition to those things, what would hinder them frombeing perfect? But now since you think that you properly adapt thepreconceptions to the particulars, tell me whence you derive this. Because Ithink so. But it does not seem so to another, and he thinks that he also makesa proper adaptation; or does he not think so? He does think so. Is it possiblethen that both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to things aboutwhich you have contrary opinions? It is not possible. Can you then show usanything better toward adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking thatyou do? Does the madman do any other things than the things as in which seem tohim right? Is then this criterion for him also? It is not sufficient. Come thento something which is superior to seeming. What is this?    Observe, this is the beginning of philosophy, a perception of thedisagreement of men with one another, and an inquiry into the cause of thedisagreement, and a condemnation and distrust of that which only "seems," and acertain investigation of that which "seems" whether it "seems" rightly, and adiscovery of some rule, as we have discovered a balance in the determination ofweights, and a carpenter's rule in the case of straight and crooked things.This is the beginning of philosophy. "Must we say that all thins are rightwhich seem so to all?" And how is it possible that contradictions can be right?"Not all then, but all which seem to us to be right." How more to you thanthose which seem right to the Syrians? why more than what seem right to theEgyptians? why more than what seems right to me or to any other man? "Not atall more." What then "seems" to every man is not sufficient for determiningwhat "is"; for neither in the case of weights or measures are we satisfied withthe bare appearance, but in each case we have discovered a certain rule. Inthis matter then is there no rule certain to what "seems?" And how is itpossible that the most necessary things among men should have no sign, and beincapable of being discovered? There is then some rule. And why then do we notseek the rule and discover it, and afterward use it without varying from it,not even stretching out the finger without it? For this, I think, is that whichwhen it is discovered cures of their madness those who use mere "seeming" as ameasure, and misuse it; so that for the future proceeding from certain thingsknown and made clear we may use in the case of particular things thepreconceptions which are distinctly fixed.    What is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring?"Pleasure." Subject it to the rule, throw it into the balance. Ought the goodto be such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it? "Yes." And inwhich we ought to confide? "It ought to be." Is it fit to trust to anythingwhich is insecure? "No." Is then pleasure anything secure? "No." Take it thenand throw it out of the scale, and drive it far away from the place of goodthings. But if you are not sharp-sighted, and one balance is not enough foryou, bring another. Is it fit to be elated over what is good? "Yes." Is itproper then to be elated over present pleasure? See that you do not say that itis proper; but if you do, I shall then not think you are worthy even of thebalance. Thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are ready. And tophilosophize is this, to examine and confirm the rules; and then to use themwhen they are known is the act of a wise and good man.

<p>
Of disputation or discussion
</p>

<p>
    What things a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art ofdisputation, has been accurately shown by our philosophers; but with respect tothe proper use of the things, we are entirely without practice. Only give toany of us, whom you please, an illiterate man to discuss with,, and he cannotdiscover how to deal with the man. But when he has moved the man a little, ifhe answers beside the purpose, he does not know how to treat him, but he theneither abuses or ridicules him, and says, "He is an illiterate man; it is notpossible to do anything with him." Now a guide, when he has found a man out ofthe road leads him into the right way: he does not ridicule or abuse him andthen leave him. Do you also show this illiterate man the truth, and you willsee that he follows. But so long as you do not show him the truth, do notridicule him, but rather feel your own incapacity.    How then did Socrates act? He used to compel his adversary in disputationto bear testimony to him, and he wanted no other witness. Therefore he couldsay, "I care not for other witnesses, but I am always satisfied with theevidence of my adversary, and I do not ask the opinion of others, but only theopinion of him who is disputing with me." For he used to make the conclusionsdrawn from natural notions so plain that every man saw the contradiction andwithdrew from it: "Does the envious man rejoice?" "By no means, but he israther pained." Well, "Do you think that envy is pain over evils? and what envyis there of evils?" Therefore he made his adversary say that envy is pain overgood things. "Well then, would any man envy those who are nothing to him?" "Byno means." Thus having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he would goaway without saying to his adversary, "Define to me envy"; and if the adversaryhad defined envy, he did not say, "You have defined it badly, for the terms ofthe definition do not correspond to the thing defined." These are technicalterms, and for this reason disagreeable and hardly intelligible to illiteratemen, which terms we cannot lay aside. But that the illiterate man himself, whofollows the appearances presented to him, should be able to concede anything orreject it, we can never by the use of these terms move him to do. Accordingly,being conscious of our own inability, we do not attempt the thing; at leastsuch of us as have any caution do not. But the greater part and the rash, whenthey enter into such disputations, confuse themselves and confuse others; andfinally abusing their adversaries and abused by them, they walk away.    Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of Socrates, never to beirritated in argument, never to utter anything abusive, anything insulting, butto bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the quarrel. If you wouldknow what great power he had in this way, read the Symposium of Xenophon, andyou will see how many quarrels he put an end to. Hence with good reason in thepoets also this power is most highly praised,       Quickly with the skill he settles great disputes.    Well then; the matter is not now very safe, and particularly at Rome; forhe who attempts to do it, must not do it in a corner, you may be sure, but mustgo to a man of consular rank, if it so happen, or to a rich man, and ask him,"Can you tell me, Sir, to whose care you have entrusted your horses?" "I cantell you." Here you entrusted them to a person indifferently and to one who hasno experience of horses? "By no means." Well then; can you tell me to whom youentrust your gold or silver things or your vestments? "I don't entrust eventhese to anyone indifferently." Well; your own body, have you alreadyconsidered about entrusting the care of it to any person? "Certainly." To a manof experience, I suppose, and one acquainted with the aliptic, or with thehealing art? "Without a doubt." Are these the best things that you have, or doyou also possess something else which is better than all these? "What kind ofthing do you mean?" That I mean which makes use of these things, and tests eachof these things and deliberates. "Is it the soul that you mean?" You thinkright, for it is the soul that I mean. "In truth I do think the soul is a muchbetter thing than all the others which I possess." Can you then show us in whatway you have taken care of the soul? for it is not likely that you, who are sowise a man and have a reputation in the city, inconsiderately and carelesslyallow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected and to perish?"Certainly not." But have you taken care of the soul yourself; and have youlearned from another to do this, or have you discovered the means yourself?Here comes the danger that in the first place he may say, "What is this to you,my good man, who are you?" Next, if you persist in troubling him, there is adanger that he may raise his hands and give you blows. I was once myself alsoan admirer of this mode of instruction until I fell into these dangers.

<p>
On anxiety
</p>

<p>
    When I see a man anxious, I say, "What does this man want? If he did notwant something which is not in his power, how could he be anxious?" For thisreason a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, but when heenters the theatre, he is anxious even if he has a good voice and plays well onthe lute; for he not only wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause: butthis is not in his power. Accordingly, where he has skill, there he hasconfidence. Bring any single person who knows nothing of music, and themusician does not care for him. But in the matter where a man knows nothing andhas not been practiced, there he is anxious. What matter is this? He knows notwhat a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd is. However he has learned tostrike the lowest chord and the highest; but what the praise of the many is,and what power it has in life he neither knows nor has he thought about it.Hence he must of necessity tremble and grow pale. I cannot then say that a manis not a lute player when I see him afraid, but I can say something else, andnot one thing, but many. And first of all I call him a stranger and say, "Thisman does not know in what part of the world he is, but though he has been hereso long, he is ignorant of the laws of the State and the customs, and what ispermitted and what is not; and he has never employed any lawyer to tell him andto explain the laws." But a man does not write a will, if he does not does notknow how it ought to be written, or he employs a person who does know; nor doeshe rashly seal a bond or write a security. But he uses his desire without alawyer's advice, and aversion, and pursuit, and attempt and purpose. "How doyou mean without a lawyer?" He does not know that he wills what is not allowed,and does not will that which is of necessity; and he does not know either whatis his own or what is or what is another man's; but if he did know, he couldnever be impeded, he would never be hindered, he would not be anxious. "How so?" Is any man then afraid about things which are not evil? "No." Is he afraidabout things which are evils, but still so far within his power that they maynot happen? "Certainly he is not." If, then, the things which are independentof the will are neither good nor bad, and all things which do depend on thewill are within our power, and no man can either take them from us or give themto us, if we do not choose, where is room left for anxiety? But we are anxiousabout our poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar; but notanxious about things internal. Are we anxious about not forming a falseopinion? No, for this is in my power. About not exerting our movements contraryto nature? No, not even about this. When then you see a man pale, as thephysician says, judging from the complexion, this man's spleen is disordered,that man's liver; so also say, this man's desire and aversion are disordered,he is not in the right way, he is in a fever. For nothing else changes thecolor, or causes trembling or chattering of the teeth, or causes a man to       Sink in his knees and shift from foot to foot.    For this reason when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus, he was not anxious,for Antigonus had no power over any of the things which Zeno admired; and Zenodid not care for those things over which Antigonus had power. But Antigonus wasanxious when he was going to meet Zeno, for he wished to please Zeno; but thiswas a thing external. But Zeno did not want to please Antigonus; for no man whois skilled in any art wishes to please one who has no such skill.    Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you know the measure by whichone man is estimated by another. Have you taken pains to learn what is a goodman and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one or the other? Why, then,are you not good yourself? "How," he replies, "am I not good?" Because no goodman laments or roans or weeps, no good man is pale and trembles, or says, "Howwill he receive me, how will he listen to me?" Slave, just as it pleases him.Why do you care about what belongs to others? Is it now his fault if hereceives badly what proceeds from you? "Certainly." And is it possible that afault should be one man's, and the evil in another? "No." Why then are youanxious about that which belongs to others? "Your question is reasonable; but Iam anxious how I shall speak to him." Cannot you then speak to him as youchoose? "But I fear that I may be disconcerted?" If you are going to write thename of Dion, are you afraid that you would be disconcerted? "By no means."Why? is it not because you have practiced writing the name? "Certainly." Well,if you were going to read the name, would you not feel the same? and why?Because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the things whichbelong to it. Have you then not practiced speaking? and what else did you learnin the school? Syllogisms and sophistical propositions? For what purpose? wasit not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully? and is not discoursingskillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and withintelligence, and also without making mistakes and without hindrance, andbesides all this with confidence? "Yes." When, then, you are mounted on a horseand go into a plain, are you anxious at being matched against a man who is onfoot, and anxious in a matter in which you are practiced, and he is not? "Yes,but that person has power to kill me." Speak the truth then, unhappy man, anddo not brag, nor claim to be a philosopher, nor refuse to acknowledge yourmasters, but so long as you present this handle in your body, follow every manwho is stronger than yourself. Socrates used to practice speaking, he whotalked as he did to the tyrants, to the dicasts, he who talked in his prison.Diogenes had practiced speaking, he who spoke as he did to Alexander, to thepirates, to the person who bought him. These men were confident in the thingswhich they practiced. But do you walk off to your own affairs and never leavethem: go and sit in a corner, and weave syllogisms, and propose them toanother. There is not in you the man who can rule a state.

<p>
To Naso
</p>

<p>
    When a certain Roman entered with his son and listened to one reading,Epictetus said, "This is the method of instruction"; and he stopped. When theRoman asked him to go on, Epictetus said: Every art, when it is taught, causeslabour to him who is unacquainted with it and is unskilled in it, and indeedthe things which proceed from the arts immediately show their use in thepurpose for which they were made; and most of them contain something attractiveand pleasing. For indeed to be present and to observe how a shoemaker learns isnot a pleasant thing; but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to lookat. And the discipline of a smith when he is learning is very disagreeable toone who chances to be present and is a stranger to the art: but the work showsthe use of the art. But you will see this much more in music; for if you arepresent while a person is learning, the discipline will appear mostdisagreeable; and yet the results of music are pleasing and delightful to thosewho know nothing of music. And here we conceive the work of a philosopher to besomething of this kind: he must adapt his wish to what is going on, so thatneither any of the things which are taking place shall take place contrary toour wish, nor any of the things which do not take place shall not take placewhen we wish that they should. From this the result is to those who have soarranged the work of philosophy, not to fall in the desire, nor to fall in withthat which they would avoid; without uneasiness, without fear, withoutperturbation to pass through life themselves, together with their associatesmaintaining the relations both natural and acquired, as the relation of son, offather, of brother, of citizen, of man, of wife, of neighbour, offellow-traveler, of ruler, of ruled. The work of a philosopher we conceive tobe something like this. It remains next to inquire how this must beaccomplished.    We see then that the carpenter when he has learned certain things becomes acarpenter; the pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot. May it not,then, in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good, andthat there is also a necessity to learn certain things? We inquire then whatthese things are. The philosophers say that we ought first to learn that thereis a God and that he provides for all things; also that it is not possible toconceal from him our acts, or even our intentions and thoughts. The next thing,is to learn what is the nature of the Gods; for such as they are discovered tobe, he, who would please and obey them, must try with all his power to be likethem. If the divine is faithful, man also must be faithful; if it is free, manalso must be free; if beneficent, man also must be beneficent; if magnanimous,man also must be magnanimous; as being, then an imitator of God, he must do andsay everything consistently with this fact.    "With what then must we begin?" If you will enter on the discussion, I willtell you that you must first understand names. "So, then, you say that I do notnow understand names?" You do not understand them. "How, then, do I use them?"Just as the illiterate use written language, as cattle use appearances: for useis one thing, understanding is another. But if you think that you understandthem, produce whatever word you please, and let us try whether we understandit. But it is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is now old and,it may be, has now served his three campaigns. I too know this: for now you arecome to me as if you were in want of nothing: and what could you even imagineto be wanting to you? You are rich, you have children, and a wife, perhaps andmany slaves: Caesar knows you, in Rome you have many friends, you render theirdues to all, you know how to requite him who does you a favour, and to repay inthe same kind him who does a wrong. What do you lack? If, then, I shall showyou that you lack the things most necessary and the chief things for happiness,and that hitherto you have looked after everything rather than what you ought,and, to crown all, that you neither know what God is nor what man is, nor whatis good nor what is bad; and as to what I have said about your ignorance ofother matters, that may perhaps be endured, but if I say that you know nothingabout yourself, how is it possible that you should endure me and bear the proofand stay here? It is not possible; but you immediately go off in bad humour.And yet what harm have I done you? unless the mirror also injures the ugly manbecause it shows him to himself such as he is; unless the physician also issupposed to insult the sick man, when he says to him, "Man, do you think thatyou ail nothing? But you have a fever: go without food to-day; drink water."And no one says, "What an insult!" But if you say to a man, "Your desires areinflamed, your aversions are low, your intentions are inconsistent, yourpursuits are not comfortable to nature, your opinions are rash and false," theman immediately goes away and says, "he has insulted me."    Our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly. Beasts are broughtto be sold and oxen; and the greater part of the men come to buy and sell, andthere are some few who come to look at the market and to inquire how it iscarried on, and why, and who fixes the meeting and for what purpose. So it ishere also in this assembly: some like cattle trouble themselves about nothingexcept their fodder. For to all of you who are busy about possessions and landsand slaves and magisterial offices, these are nothing except fodder. But thereare a few who attend the assembly, men who love to look on and consider what isthe world, who governs it. Has it no governor? And how is it possible that acity or a family cannot continue to exist, not even the shortest time withoutan administrator and guardian, and that so great and beautiful a system shouldbe administered with such order and yet without a purpose and by chance? Thereis then an administrator. What kind of administrator and how does he govern?And who are we, who were produced by him, and for what purpose? Have we someconnection with him and some relation toward him, or none? This is the way inwhich these few are affected, and then they apply themselves only to this onething, to examine the meeting and then to go away. What then? They areridiculed by the many, as the spectators at the fair are by the traders; and ifthe beasts had any understanding, they would ridicule those who admiredanything else than fodder.

To or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determined
</p>

<p>
    When some persons have heard these words, that a man ought to be constant,and that the will is naturally free and not subject to compulsion, but that allother things are subject to hindrance, to slavery, and are in the power ofothers, they suppose that they ought without deviation to abide by everythingwhich they have determined. But in the first place that which has beendetermined ought to be sound. I require tone in the body, but such as exists ina healthy body, in an athletic body; but if it is plain to me that you have thetone of a frenzied man and you boast of it, I shall say to you, "Man, seek thephysician": this is not tone, but atony. In a different way something of thesame kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner;which was the case with one of my companions who for no reason resolved tostarve himself to death. I heard of it when it was the third day of hisabstinence from food and I went to inquire what had happened. "I haveresolved," he said. But still tell me what it was which induced you to resolve;for if you have resolved rightly, we shall sit with you and assist you todepart; but if you have made an unreasonable resolution, change your mind. "Weought to keep to our determinations." What are you doing, man? We ought to keepnot to all our determinations, but to those which are right; for if you are nowpersuaded that it is right, do not change your mind, if you think fit, butpersist and say, "We ought to abide by our determinations." Will you not makethe beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether the determination issound or not sound, and so then build on it firmness and security? But if youlay a rotten and ruinous foundation, will not your miserable little buildingfall down the sooner, the more and the stronger are the materials which youshall lay on it? Without any reason would you withdraw from us out of life aman who is a friend, and a companion, a citizen of the same city, both thegreat and the small city? Then, while you are committing murder and destroyinga man who has done no wrong, do you say that you ought to abide by yourdeterminations? And if it ever in any way came into your head to kill me, oughtyou to abide by your determinations?    Now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change his mind. But it isimpossible to convince some persons at present; so that I seem now to know,what I did not know, before, the meaning of the common saying, "That you canneither persuade nor break a fool." May it never be my lot to have a wise foolfor my friend: nothing is more untractable. "I am determined," the man says.Madmen are also; but the more firmly they form a judgment on things which donot exist, the more ellebore they require. Will you not act like a sick man andcall in the physician? "I am sick, master, help me; consider what I must do: itis my duty to obey you." So it is here also: "I know not what I ought to do,but I am come to learn." Not so; but, "Speak to me about other things: uponthis I have determined." What other things? for what is greater and more usefulthan for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made yourdetermination and not to change it. This is the tone of madness, not of health."I will die, if you compel me to this." Why, man? What has happened? "I havedetermined." I have had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill me."I take no money." Why? "I have determined." Be assured that with the very tonewhich you now use in refusing to take, there is nothing to hinder you at sometime from inclining without reason to take money and then saying, "I havedetermined." As in a distempered body, subject to defluxions, the humorinclines sometimes to these parts and then to those, so too a sickly soul knowsnot which way to incline: but if to this inclination and movement there isadded a tone, then the evil becomes past help and cure.

That we do not strive to use our opinions about good and evil
</p>

<p>
    Where is the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where isneither of them? In those things which are independent of the will. Well then?Does any one among us think of these lessons out of the schools? Does any onemeditate by himself to give an answer to things as in the case of questions? Isit day? "Yes." Is it night? "No." Well, is the number of stars even? "I cannotsay." When money is shown to you, have you studied to make the proper answer,that money is not a good thing? Have you practiced yourself in these answers,or only against sophisms? Why do you wonder then if in the cases which you havestudied, in those you have improved; but in those which you have not studied,in those you remain the same? When the rhetorician knows that he has writtenwell, that he has committed to memory what he has written, and brings anagreeable voice, why is he still anxious? Because he is not satisfied withhaving studied. What then does he want? To be praised by the audience? For thepurpose, then, of being able to practice declamation, he has been disciplined:but with respect to praise and blame he has not been disciplined. For when didhe hear from any one what praise is, what blame is, what the nature of each is,what kind of praise should be sought, or what kind of blame should be shunned?And when did he practice this discipline which follows these words? Why then doyou still wonder if, in the matters which a man has learned, there he surpassesothers, and in those in which he has not been disciplined, there he is the samewith the many. So the lute player knows how to play, sings well, and has a finedress, and yet he trembles when he enters on the stage; for these matters heunderstands, but he does not know what a crowd is, nor the shouts of a crowd,nor what ridicule is. Neither does he know what anxiety is, whether it is ourwork or the work of another, whether it is possible to stop it or not. For thisreason, if he has been praised, he leaves the theatre puffed up, but if he hasbeen ridiculed, the swollen bladder has been punctured and subsides.    This is the case also with ourselves. What do we admire? Externals. Aboutwhat things are we busy? Externals. And have we any doubt then why we fear orwhy we are anxious? What, then, happens when we think the things which arecoming on us to be evils? It is not in our power not to be afraid, it is not inour power not to be anxious. Then we say, "Lord God, how shall I not beanxious?" Fool, have you not hands, did not God make them for you, Sit down nowand pray that your nose may not run. Wipe yourself rather and do not blame him.Well then, has he given to you nothing in the present case? Has he not given toyou endurance? has he not given to you magnanimity? has he not given to youmanliness? When you have such hands, do you look for one who shall wipe youryou st nose? But we neither study these things nor care for them. Give me a manwho cares how he shall do anything, not for the obtaining of a thing but whocares about his own energy. What man, when he is walking about, cares for hisown energy? who, when he is deliberating, cares about his own deliberation, andnot about obtaining that about which he deliberates? And if he succeeds, he iselated and says, "How well we have deliberated; did I not tell you, brother,that it is impossible, when we have thought about anything, that it should notturn out thus?" But if the thing should turn out otherwise, the wretched man ishumbled; he knows not even what to say about what has taken place. Who among usfor the sake of this matter has consulted a seer? Who among us as to hisactions has not slept in indifference? Who? Give to me one that I may see theman whom I have long been looking for, who is truly noble and ingenuous,whether young or old; name him.    Why then are we still surprised, if we are well practiced in thinking aboutmatters, but in our acts are low, without decency, worthless, cowardly,impatient of labour, altogether bad? For we do not care about things, nor do westudy them. But if we had feared not death or banishment, but fear itself, weshould have studied not to fall into those things which appear to us evils. Nowin the school we are irritable and wordy; and if any little question arisesabout any of these things, we are able to examine them fully. But drag us topractice, and you will find us miserably shipwrecked. Let some disturbingappearance come on us, and you will know what we have been studying and in whatwe have been exercising ourselves. Consequently, through want of discipline, weare always adding something to the appearance and representing things to begreater than what they are. For instance as to myself, when I am on a voyageand look down on the deep sea, or look round on it and see no land, I am out ofmy mind and imagine that I must drink up all this water if I am wrecked, and itdoes not occur to me that three pints are enough. What then disturbs me? Thesea? No, but my opinion. Again, when an earthquake shall happen, I imagine thatthe city is going to fall on me; is not one little stone enough to knock mybrains out?    What then are the things which are heavy on us and disturb us? What elsethan opinions? What else than opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away andleaves his companions and friends and places and habits of life? Now littlechildren, for instance, when they cry on the nurse leaving them for a shorttime, forget their sorrow if they receive a small cake. Do you choose then thatwe should compare you to little children? No, by Zeus, for I do not wish to bepacified by a small cake, but by right opinions. And what are these? Such as aman ought to study all day, and not to be affected by anything that is not hisown, neither by companion nor place nor gymnasia, and not even by his own body,but to remember the law and to have it before his eyes. And what is the divinelaw? To keep a man's own, not to claim that which belongs to others, but to usewhat is given, and when it is not given, not to desire it; and when a thing istaken away, to give it up readily and immediately, and to be thankful for thetime that a man has had the use of it, if you would not cry for your nurse andmamma. For what matter does it make by what thing a man is subdued, and on whathe depends? In what respect are you better than he who cries for a girl, if yougrieve for a little gymnasium, and little porticoes and young men and suchplaces of amusement? Another comes and laments that he shall no longer drinkthe water of Dirce. Is the Marcian water worse than that of Dirce? "But I wasused to the water of Dirce?" And you in turn will be used to the other. Then ifyou become attached to this also, cry for this too, and try to make a verselike the verse of Euripides,       The hot baths of Nero and the Marcian water.See how tragedy is made when common things happen to silly men.    "When then shall I see Athens again and the Acropolis?" Wretch, are you notcontent with what you see daily? have you anything better or greater to seethan the sun, the moon, the stars, the whole earth, the sea? But if indeed youcomprehend him who administers the Whole, and carry him about in yourself, doyou still desire small stones, and a beautiful rock? When, then, you are goingto leave the sun itself and the moon, what will you do? will you sit and weeplike children? Well, what have you been doing in the school? what did you hear,what did you learn? why did you write yourself a philosopher, when you mighthave written the truth; as, "I made certain introductions, and I readChrysippus, but I did not even approach the door of a philosopher." For howshould I possess anything of the kind which Socrates possessed, who died as hedid, who lived as he did, or anything such as Diogenes possessed? Do you thinkthat any one of such men wept or grieved, because he was not going to see acertain man, or a certain woman, nor to be in Athens or in Corinth, but, if itshould so happen, in Susa or in Ecbatana? For if a man can quit the banquetwhen he chooses, and no longer amuse himself, does he still stay and complain,and does he not stay, as at any amusement, only so long as he is pleased? Sucha man, I suppose, would endure perpetual exile or to be condemned to death.Will you not be weaned now, like children, and take more solid food, and notcry after mammas and nurses, which are the lamentations of old women? "But if Igo away, I shall cause them sorrow." You cause them sorrow? By no means; butthat will cause them sorrow which also causes you sorrow, opinion. What haveyou to do then? Take away your own opinion, and if these women are wise, theywill take away their own: if they do not, they will lament through their ownfault.    My man, as the proverb says, make a desperate effort on behalf oftranquillity of mind, freedom and magnanimity. Lift up your head at last asreleased from slavery. Dare to look up to God and say, "Deal with me for thefuture as thou wilt; I am of the same mind as thou art; I am thine: I refusenothing that pleases thee: lead me where thou wilt: clothe me in any dress thouchoosest: is it thy will that I should hold the office of a magistrate, that Ishould be in the condition of a private man, stay there or be an exile, bepoor, be rich? I will make thy defense to men in behalf of all theseconditions. I will show the nature of each thing what it is." You will not doso; but sit in an ox's belly, and wait for your mamma till she shall feed you.Who would Hercules have been, if he had sat at home? He would have beenEurystheus and not Hercules. Well, and in his travels through the world howmany intimates and how many friends had he? But nothing more dear to him thanGod. For this reason it was believed that he was the son of God, and he was. Inobedience to God, then, he went about purging away injustice and lawlessness.But you are not Hercules and you are not able to purge away the wickedness ofothers; nor yet are you Theseus, able to pure away the evil things of Attica.Clear away your own. From yourself, from your thoughts cast away, instead ofProcrustes and Sciron, sadness, fear, desire, envy, malevolence, avarice,effeminacy, intemperance. But it is not possible to eject these thingsotherwise than by looking to God only, by fixing your affections on him only,by being consecrated to his commands. But if you choose anything else, you willwith sighs and groans be compelled to follow what is stronger than yourself,always seeking tranquillity and never able to find it; for you seektranquillity there where it is not, and you neglect to seek it where it is.

How we must adapt preconceptions to particular cases
</p>

<p>
    What is the first business of him who philosophizes? To throw awayself-conceit. For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which hethinks that he knows. As to things then which ought to be done and ought not tobe done, and good and bad, and beautiful and ugly, all of us talking of them atrandom go to the philosophers; and on these matters we praise, we censure, weaccuse, we blame, we judge and determine about principles honourable anddishonourable. But why do we go to the philosophers? Because we wish to learnwhat we do not think we know. And what is this? Theorems. For we wish to learnwhat philosophers say as being something elegant and acute; and some wish tolearn that they may get profit what they learn. It is ridiculous then to thinkthat a person wishes to learn one thing, and will learn another; or further,that a man will make proficiency in that which he does not learn. But the manyare deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician Theopompus, when heblames even Plato for wishing everything to be defined. For what does he say?"Did none of us before you use the words 'good' or 'just,' or do we utter thesounds in an unmeaning and empty way without understanding what they severallysignify?" Now who tells you, Theopompus, that we had not natural notions ofeach of these things and preconceptions? But it is not possible to adaptpreconceptions to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguishedthem, and inquired what object must be subjected to each preconception. You maymake the same charge against physicians also. For who among us did not use thewords "healthy" and "unhealthy" before Hippocrates lived, or did we utter thesewords as empty sounds? For we have also a certain preconception of health, butwe are not able to adapt it. For this reason one says, "Abstain from food";another says, "Give food"; another says, "Bleed"; and another says, "Usecupping." What is the reason? is it any other than that a man cannot properlyadapt the preconception of health to particulars?    So it is in this matter also, in the things which concern life. Who amongus does not speak of good and bad, of useful and not useful; for who among ushas not a preconception of each of these things? Is it then a distinct andperfect preconception? Show this. How shall I show this? Adapt thepreconception properly to the particular things. Plato, for instance, subjectsdefinitions to the preconception of the useful, but you to the preconception ofthe useless. Is it possible then that both of you are right? How is itpossible? Does not one man adapt the preconception of good to the matter ofwealth, and another not to wealth, but to the matter of pleasure and to that ofhealth? For, generally, if all of us who use those words know sufficiently eachof them, and need no diligence in resolving, the notions of the preconceptions,why do we differ, why do we quarrel, why do we blame one another?    And why do I now allege this contention with one another and speak of it?If you yourself properly adapt your preconceptions, why are you unhappy, whyare you hindered? Let us omit at present the second topic about the pursuitsand the study of the duties which relate to them. Let us omit also the thirdtopic, which relates to the assents: I give up to you these two topics. Let usinsist upon the first, which presents an almost obvious demonstration that wedo not properly adapt the preconceptions. Do you now desire that which ispossible and that which is possible to you? Why then are you hindered? why areyou unhappy? Do you not now try to avoid the unavoidable? Why then do you fallin with anything which you would avoid? Why are you unfortunate? Why, when youdesire a thing, does it not happen, and, when you do not desire it, does ithappen? For this is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery: "I wish forsomething, and it does not happen." And what is more wretched than I?    It was because she could not endure this that Medea came to murder herchildren: an act of a noble spirit in this view at least, for she had a justopinion what it is for a thing not to succeed which a person wishes. Then shesays, "Thus I shall be avenged on him who has wronged and insulted me; and whatshall I gain if he is punished thus? how then shall it be done? I shall kill mychildren, but I shall punish myself also: and what do I care?" This is theaberration of soul which possesses great energy. For she did not know whereinlies the doing of that which we wish; that you cannot get this from without,nor yet by the alteration and new adaptation of things. Do not desire the man,and nothing which you desire will fall to happen: do not obstinately desirethat he shall live with you: do not desire to remain in Corinth; and, in aword, desire nothing than that which God wills. And who shall hinder you? whoshall compel you? No man shall compel you any more than he shall compel Zeus.    When you have such a guide, and your wishes and desires are the same ashis, why do you fear disappointment? Give up your desire to wealth and youraversion to poverty, and you will be disappointed in the one, you will fallinto the other. Well, give them up to health, and you will be unfortunate: givethem up to magistracies, honours, country, friends, children, in a word to anyof the things which are not in man's power. But give them up to Zeus and to therest of the gods; surrender them to the gods, let the gods govern, let yourdesire and aversion be ranged on the side of the gods, and wherein will you beany longer unhappy? But if, lazy wretch, you envy, and complain, and arejealous, and fear, and never cease for a single day complaining both ofyourself and of the gods, why do you still speak of being educated? What kindof an education, man? Do you mean that you have been employed about sophisticalsyllogisms? Will you not, if it is possible, unlearn all these things and beginfrom the beginning, and see at the same time that hitherto you have not eventouched the matter; and then, commencing from this foundation, will you notbuild up all that comes after, so that nothing, may happen which you do notchoose, and nothing shall fail to happen which you do choose?    Give me one young man who has come to the school with this intention, whois become a champion for this matter and says, "I give up everything else, andit is enough for me if "t shall ever be in my power to pass my life free fromhindrance and free from trouble, and to stretch out my neck to all things likea free man, and to look up to heaven as a friend of God, and fear nothing thatcan happen." Let any of you point out such a man that I may "Come, young man,into the possession of that which is your own, it is your destiny to adornphilosophy: yours are these possessions, yours these books, yours thesediscourses." Then when he shall have laboured sufficiently and exercisedhimself in this of the matter, let him come to me again and say, "I desire tobe free from passion and free from perturbation; and I wish as a pious man anda philosopher and a diligent person to know what is my duty to the gods, whatto my parents, what to my brothers, what to my country, what to strangers."Come also to the second matter: this also is yours. "But I have nowsufficiently studied the second part also, and I would gladly be secure andunshaken, and not only when I am awake, but also when I am asleep, and when Iam filled with wine, and when I am melancholy." Man, you are a god, you havegreat designs.    "No: but I wish to understand what Chrysippus says in his treatise of thePseudomenos." Will you not hang yourself, wretch, with such your intention? Andwhat good will it do you? You will read the whole with sorrow, and you willspeak to others trembling, Thus you also do. "Do you wish me, brother, to readto you, and you to me?" "You write excellently, my man; and you alsoexcellently in the style of Xenophon, and you in the style of Plato, and you inthe style of Antisthenes." Then, having told your dreams to one another, youreturn to the same things: your desires are the same, your aversions the same,your pursuits are the same, and your designs and purposes, you wish for thesame things and work for the same. In the next place you do not even seek forone to give you advice, but you are vexed if you hear such things. Then yousay, "An ill-natured old fellow: when I was going away, he did not weep nor didhe say, 'Into what danger you are going: if you come off safe, my child, I willburn lights.' This is what a good-natured man would do." It will be a greatthing for you if you do return safe, and it will be worth while to burn lightsfor such a person: for you ought to be immortal and exempt from disease.    Casting away then, as I say, this conceit of thinking that we knowsomething useful, we I I must come to philosophy as we apply to geometry, andto music: but if we do not, we shall not even approach to proficiency, thoughwe read all the collections and commentaries of Chrysippus and those ofAntipater and Archedemus.

How we should struggle against appearances
</p>

<p>
    Every habit and faculty is maintained and increased by the correspondingactions: the habit of walking by walking, the habit of running by running. Ifyou would be a good reader, read; if a writer, write. But when you shall nothave read thirty days in succession, but have done something else, you willknow the consequence. In the same way, if you shall have lain down ten days,get up and attempt to make a long walk, and you will see how your legs areweakened. Generally, then, if you would make anything a habit, do it; if youwould not make it a habit, do not do it, but accustom yourself to do somethingelse in place of it.    So it is with respect to the affections of the soul: when you have beenangry, you must know that not only has this evil befallen you, but that youhave also increased the habit, and in a manner thrown fuel upon fire. When youhave been overcome in sexual intercourse with a person, do not reckon thissingle defeat only, but reckon that you have also nurtured, increased yourincontinence. For it is impossible for habits and faculties, some of them notto be produced, when they did not exist before, and others not be increased andstrengthened by corresponding acts.    In this manner certainly, as philosophers say, also diseases of the mindgrow up. For when you have once desired money, if reason be applied to lead toa perception of the evil, the desire is stopped, and the ruling faculty of ourmind is restored to the original authority. But if you apply no means of cure,it no longer returns to the same state, but, being again excited by thecorresponding appearance, it is inflamed to desire quicker than before: andwhen this takes place continually, it is henceforth hardened, and the diseaseof the mind confirms the love of money. For he who has had a fever, and hasbeen relieved from it, is not in the same state that he was before, unless hehas been completely cured. Something of the kind happens also in diseases ofthe soul. Certain traces and blisters are left in it, and unless a man shallcompletely efface them, when he is again lashed on the same places, the lashwill produce not blisters but sores. If then you wish not to be of an angrytemper, do not feed the habit; throw nothing on it which will increase it: atfirst keep quiet, and count the days on which you have not been angry. I usedto be in passion every day; now every second day; then every third, then everyfourth. But if you have intermitted thirty days, make a sacrifice to God. Forthe habit at first begins to be weakened, and then is completely destroyed. "Ihave not been vexed to-day, nor the day after, nor yet on any succeeding dayduring two or three months; but I took care when some exciting thingshappened." Be assured that you are in a good way. To-day when I saw a handsomeperson, I did not say to myself, "I wish I could lie with her," and "Happy isher husband"; for he who says this says, "Happy is her adulterer also." Nor doI picture the rest to my mind; the woman present, and stripping herself andlying down by my side. I stroke my head and say, "Well done, Epictetus, youhave solved a fine little sophism, much finer than that which is called themaster sophism." And if even the woman is willing, and gives signs, and sendsmessages, and if she also fondle me and come close to me, and I should abstainand be victorious, that would be a sophism beyond that which is named "TheLiar," and "The Quiescent." Over such a victory as this a man may justly beproud; not for proposing, the master sophism.    How then shall this be done? Be willing at length to be approved byyourself, be willing to appear beautiful to God, desire to he in purity withyour own pure self and with God. Then when any such appearance visits you,Plato says, "Have recourse to expiations, go a suppliant to the temples of theaverting deities." It is even sufficient if "you resort to the society of nobleand just men," and compare yourself with them, whether you find one who isliving or dead. Go to Socrates and see him lying down with Alcibiades, andmocking his beauty: consider what a victory he at last found that he had gainedover himself; what an Olympian victory; in what number he stood from Hercules;so that, by the Gods, one may justly salute him, "Hail, wondrous man, you whohave conquered not less these sorry boxers and pancratiasts nor yet those whoare like them, the gladiators." By placing these objects on the other side youwill conquer the appearance: you will not be drawn away by it. But, in thefirst place, be not hurried away by the rapidity of the appearance, but say,"Appearances, wait for me a little: let me see who you are, and what you areabout: let me put you to the test." And then do not allow the appearance tolead you on and draw lively pictures of the things which will follow; for ifyou do, it will carry you off wherever it pleases. But rather bring in tooppose it some other beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this baseappearance. And if you are accustomed to be exercised in this way, you will seewhat shoulders, what sinews, what strength you have. But now it is onlytrifling words, and nothing more.    This is the true athlete, the man who exercises himself against suchappearances. Stay, wretch, do not be carried away. Great is the combat, divineis the work; it is for kingship, for freedom, for happiness, for freedom fromperturbation. Remember God: call on him as a helper and protector, as men atsea call on the Dioscuri in a storm. For what is a greater storm than thatwhich comes from appearances which are violent and drive away the reason? Forthe storm itself, what else is it but an appearance? For take away the fear ofdeath, and suppose as many thunders and lightnings as you please, and you willknow what calm and serenity there is in the ruling faculty. But if you haveonce been defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter, then say the sameagain, be assured that you at last be in so wretched a condition and so weakthat you will not even know afterward that you are doing wrong, but you willeven begin to make apologies for your wrongdoing, and then you will confirm thesaying of Hesiod to be true,       With constant ills the dilatory strives.

Against those who embrace, philosophical opinions only in words
</p>

<p>
    The argument called the "ruling argument" appears to have been proposedfrom such principles as these: there is in fact a common contradiction betweenone another in these three positions, each two being in contradiction to thethird. The propositions are, that everything past must of necessity be true;that an impossibility does not follow a possibility; and that thing is possiblewhich neither is nor t at a t will be true. Diodorus observing thiscontradiction employed the probative force of the first two for thedemonstration of this proposition, "That nothing is possible which is not trueand never will be." Now another will hold these two: "That something ispossible, which is neither true nor ever will be": and "That an impossibilitydoes not follow a possibility," But he will not allow that everything which ispast is necessarily true, as the followers of Cleanthes seem to think, andAntipater copiously defended them. But others maintain the other twopropositions, "That a thing is possible which is neither true nor will hetrue": and "That everything which is past is necessarily true"; but then theywill maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility. But it isimpossible to maintain these three propositions, because of their commoncontradiction. If then any man should ask me which of these propositions do Imaintain? I will answer him that I do not know; but I have received this story,that Diodorus maintained one opinion, the followers of Panthoides, I think, andCleanthes maintained another opinion, and those of Chrysippus a third. "Whatthen is your opinion?" I was not made for this purpose, to examine theappearances that occur to me and to compare what others say and to form anopinion of my own on the thing. Therefore I differ not at all from thegrammarian. "Who was Hector's father?" Priam. "Who were his brothers?"Alexander and Deiphobus. "Who was their mother?" Hecuba. I have heard thisstory. "From whom?" From Homer. And Hellanicus also, I think, writes about thesame things, and perhaps others like him. And what further have I about theruling argument? Nothing. But, if I am a vain man, especially at a banquet, Isurprise the guests by enumerating those who have written on these matters.Both Chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book about"Possibilities," and Cleanthes has written specially on the subject, andArchedemus. Antipater also has written not only in his work about"Possibilities," but also separately in his work on the ruling argument. Haveyou not read the work? "I have not read it." Read. And what profit will a manhave from it? he will be more trifling and impertinent than he is now; for whatelse have you rained by reading it? What opinion have you formed on thissubject? none; but you will tell us of Helen and Priam, and the island ofCalypso which never was and never will be. And in this matter indeed it is ofno great importance if you retain the story, but have formed no opinion of yourown. But in matters of morality this happens to us much more than in thesethings of which we are speaking.    "Speak to me about good and evil." Listen:       The wind from Ilium to Ciconian shores       Brought me.    "Of things some are good, some are bad, and others are indifferent. Thegood then are the virtues and the things which partake of the virtues; the badare the vices, and the things which partake of them; and the indifferent arethe things which lie between the virtues and the vices, wealth, health, life,death, pleasure, pain." Whence do you know this? "Hellanicus says it in hisEgyptian history"; for what difference does it make to say this, or to say that"Diogenes has it in his Ethic," or Chrysippus or Cleanthes? Have you thenexamined any of these things and formed an opinion of your own? Show how youare used to behave in a storm on shipboard? Do you remember this division, whenthe sail rattles and a man, who knows nothing of times and seasons, stands byyou when you are screaming and says, "Tell me, I ask you by the Gods, what youwere saying just now. Is it a vice to suffer shipwreck: does it participate invice?" Will you not take up a stick and lay it on his head? What have we to dowith you, man? we are perishing and you come to mock us? But if Caesar sent foryou to answer a charge, do you remember the distinction? If, when you are goingin, pale and trembling, a person should come up to you and say, "Why do youtremble, man? what is the matter about which you are engaged? Does Caesar whosits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to him?" You reply, "Why doyou also mock me and add to my present sorrows?" Still tell me, philosopher,tell me why you tremble? Is it not death of which you run the risk, or aprison, or pain of the body, or banishment, or disgrace? What else is there? Isthere any vice or anything which partakes of vice? What then did you use to sayof these things? "What have you to do with me, man? my own evils are enough forme." And you say right. Your own evils are enough for you, your baseness, yourcowardice, your boasting which you showed when you sat in the school. Why didyou decorate yourself with what belonged to others? Why did you call yourself aStoic?    Observe yourselves thus in your actions, and you will find to what sect youbelong. You will find that most of you are Epicureans, a few Peripatetics, andthose feeble. For wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equalto everything else or even superior? But show me a Stoic, if you can. Where orhow? But you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of theStoics. For do the same persons repeat the Epicurean opinions any worse? Andthe Peripatetic, do they not handle them also with equal accuracy? who then isa Stoic? As we call a statue Phidiac which is fashioned according to the art ofPhidias; so show me a man who is fashioned according to the doctrines which heutters. Show me a man who is sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying andhappy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him: I desire, by thegods, to see a Stoic. You cannot show me one fashioned so; but show me at leastone who is forming, who has shown a tendency to be a Stoic. Do me this favor:do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which I have not seen yet. Do you thinkthat you must show me the Zeus of Phidias or the Athena, a work of ivory andgold? Let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as God does, and notto blame either God or man, ready not to be disappointed about anything, not toconsider himself damaged by anything, not to be angry, not to be envious, notto be jealous; and why should I not say it direct? desirous from a man tobecome a god, and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship withZeus. Show me the man. But you cannot. Why then do you delude yourselves andcheat others? and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you, andwalk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do notbelong to you?    And now I am your teacher, and you are instructed in my school. And I havethis purpose, to make you free from restraint, compulsion, hindrance, to makeyou free, prosperous, happy, looking to God in everything small and great. Andyou are here to learn and practice these things. Why, then, do you not finishthe work, if you also have such a purpose as you ought to have, and if I, inaddition to the purpose, also have such qualification as I ought to have? Whatis that which is wanting? When I see an artificer and material by him, I expectthe work. Here, then, is the artificer, here the material; what is it that wewant? Is not the thing, one that can be taught? It is. Is it not then in ourpower? The only thing of all that is in our power. Neither wealth is in ourpower, nor health, nor reputation, nor in a word anything else except the rightuse of appearances. This is by nature free from restraint, this alone is freefrom impediment. Why then do you not finish the work? Tell me the reason. Forit is either through my fault that you do not finish it, or through your ownfault, or through the nature of the thing. The thing itself is possible, andthe only thing in our power. It remains then that the fault is either in me orin you, or, what is nearer the truth, in both. Well then, are you willing thatwe begin at last to bring such a purpose into this school, and to take nonotice of the past? Let us only make a beginning. Trust to me, and you willsee.

Against the Epicureans and Academics
</p>

<p>
    The propositions which are true and evident are of necessity used even bythose who contradict them: and a man might perhaps consider it to be thegreatest proof of a thing being evident that it is found to be necessary evenfor him who denies it to make use of it at the same time. For instance, if aman should deny that there is anything universally true, it is plain that hemust make the contradictory negation, that nothing is universally true. What,wretch, do you not admit even this? For what else is this than to affirm thatwhatever is universally affirmed is false? Again, if a man should come forwardand say: "Know that there is nothing that can be known, but all things areincapable of sure evidence"; or if another say, "Believe me and you will be thebetter for it, that a man ought not to believe anything"; or again, if anothershould say, "Learn from me, man, that it is not possible to learn anything; Itell you this and will teach you, if you choose." Now in what respect do thesediffer from those? Whom shall I name? Those who call themselves Academics?"Men, agree that no man agrees: believe us that no man believes anybody."    Thus Epicurus also, when he designs to destroy the natural fellowship ofmankind, at the same time makes use of that which he destroys. For what does hesay? "Be not deceived men, nor be led astray, nor be mistaken: there is nonatural fellowship among rational animals; believe me. But those who sayotherwise, deceive you and seduce you by false reasons." What is this to you?Permit us to be deceived. Will you fare worse, if all the rest of us arepersuaded that there is a natural fellowship among us, and that it ought by allmeans to be preserved? Nay, it will be much better and safer for you. Man, whydo you trouble yourself about us? Why do you keep awake for us? Why do youlight your lamp? Why do you rise early? Why do you write so many books, that noone of us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they take care ofmen; or that no one may suppose the nature of good to be other than pleasure?For if this is so, lie down and sleep, and lead the life of a worm, of whichyou judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women, and ease yourself,and snore. And what is it to you, how the rest shall think about these things,whether right or wrong? For what have we to do with you? You take care of sheepbecause they supply us with wool, and milk, and, last of all, with their flesh.Would it not be a desirable thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by theStoics, and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like you to beshorn and milked? For this you ought to say to your brother Epicureans: butought you not to conceal it from others, and particularly before everything topersuade them that we are by nature adapted for fellowship, that temperance isa good thing; in order that all things may be secured for you? Or ought we tomaintain this fellowship with some and not with others? With whom, then, oughtwe to maintain it? With such as on their part also maintain it, or with such asviolate this fellowship? And who violate it more than you who establish suchdoctrines?    What then was it that waked Epicurus from his sleepiness, and compelled himto write what he did write? What else was it than that which is the strongestthing in men, nature, which draws a man to her own will though he be unwillingand complaining? "For since," she says, "you think that there is no communityamong mankind, write this opinion and leave it for others, and break your sleepto do this, and by your own practice condemn your own opinions." Shall we thensay that Orestes was agitated by the Erinyes and roused from his deep sleep,and did not more savage Erinyes and Pains rouse Epicurus from his sleep and notallow him to rest, but compelled him to make known his own evils, as madnessand wine did the Galli? So strong and invincible is man's nature. For how can avine be moved not in the mariner of a vine, but in the manner of an olive tree?or on the other hand how can an olive tree be moved not in the manner of anolive tree, but in the manner of a vine? It is impossible: it cannot beconceived. Neither then is it possible for a man completely to lose themovements of a man; and even those who are deprived of their genital membersare not able to deprive themselves of man's desires. Thus Epicurus alsomutilated all the offices of a man, and of a father of a family, and of acitizen and of a friend, but he did not mutilate human desires, for he couldnot; not more than the lazy Academics can cast away or blind their own senses,though they have tried with all their might to do it. What a shame is this?when a man has received from nature measures and rules for the knowing oftruth, and does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to improvethem, but, just the contrary, endeavors to take away and destroy whateverenables us to discern the truth?    What say you philosopher? piety and sanctity, what do you think that theyare? "If you like, I will demonstrate that they are good things." Well,demonstrate it, that our citizens may be turned and honor the deity and may nolonger be negligent about things of the highest value. "Have you then thedemonstrations?" I have, and I am thankful. "Since then you are well pleasedwith them, hear the contrary: 'That there are no Gods, and, if there are, theytake no care of men, nor is there any fellowship between us and them; and thatthis piety and sanctity which is talked of among most men is the lying ofboasters and sophists, or certainly of legislators for the purpose ofterrifying and checking wrong-doers.'" Well done, philosopher, you have donesomething for our citizens, you have brought back all the young men to contemptof things divine. "What then, does not this satisfy you? Learn now, thatjustice is nothing, that modesty is folly, that a father is nothing, a sonnothing." Well done, philosopher, persist, persuade the young men, that we mayhave more with the same opinions as you who say the same as you. From such youan principles as those have grown our well-constituted states; by these wasSparta founded: Lycurgus fixed these opinions in the Spartans by his laws andeducation, that neither is the servile condition more base than honourable, northe condition of free men more honorable than base, and that those who died atThermopylae died from these opinions; and through what other opinions did theAthenians leave their city? Then those who talk thus, marry and beget children,and employ themselves in public affairs and make themselves priests andinterpreters. Of whom? of gods who do not exist: and they consult the Pythianpriestess that they may hear lies, and they repeat the oracles to others.Monstrous impudence and imposture.    Man what are you doing? are you refuting yourself every day; and will younot give up these frigid attempts? When you eat, where do you carry your handto? to your mouth or to your eye? when you wash yourself, what do you go into?do you ever call a pot a dish, or a ladle a spit? If I were a slave of any ofthese men, even if I must be flayed by him dally, I would rack him. If he said,"Boy, throw some olive-oil into the bath," I would take pickle sauce and pourit down on his head. "What is this?" he would say. An appearance was presentedto me, I swear by your genius, which could not be distinguished from oil andwas exactly like it. "Here give me the barley drink," he says. I would fill andcarry him a dish of sharp sauce. "Did I not ask for the barley drink?" Yes,master; this is the barley drink. "Take it and smell; take it and taste." Howdo you know then if our senses deceive us? If I had three or four fellow-slavesof the same opinion, I should force him to hang himself through passion or tochange his mind. But now they mock us by using all the things which naturegives, and in words destroying them.    Grateful indeed are men and modest, who, if they do nothing else, are dailyeating bread and yet are shameless enough to say, we do not know if there is aDemeter or her daughter Persephone or a Pluto; not to mention that they areenjoying the night and the day, the seasons of the year, and the stars, and thesea, and the land, and the co-operation of mankind, and yet they are not movedin any degree by these things to turn their attention to them; but they onlyseek to belch out their little problem, and when they have exercised theirstomach to go off to the bath. But what they shall say, and about what thingsor to what persons, and what their hearers shall learn from this talk, theycare not even in the least degree, nor do they care if any generous youth afterhearing such talk should suffer any harm from it, nor after he has sufferedharm should lose all the seeds of his generous nature: nor if we should give anadulterer help toward being shameless in his acts; nor if a public peculatorshould lay hold of some cunning excuse from these doctrines; nor if another whoneglects his parents should be confirmed in his audacity by this teaching. Whatthen in your opinion is good or bad? This or that? Why then should a man sayany more in reply to such persons as these, or give them any reason or listento any reasons from them, or try to convince them? By Zeus one might muchsooner expect to make certainties change their mind than those who are becomeso deaf and blind to their own evils.

<p>
Of inconsistency
</p>

<p>
    Some things men readily confess, and other things they do not. No one thenwill confess that he is a fool or without understanding; but, quite thecontrary, you will hear all men saying, "I wish that I had fortune equal to myunderstanding." But readily confess that they are timid, and they say: "I amrather timid, I confess; but to other respects you will not find me tofoolish." A man will not readily confess that he is intemperate; and that he isunjust he will not confess at all. He will by no means confess that be isenvious or a busybody. Most men will confess that they are compassionate. Whatthen is the reason? The chief thing is inconsistency and confusion in thethings which relate to good and evil. But different men have different reasons;and generally what they imagine to be base, they do not confess at all. Butthey suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition, andcompassion also; but silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave.And they do not at all admit the things which are offenses against society. Butin the case of most errors, for this reason chiefly, they are induced toconfess them, because they that there is something involuntary in them as intimidity and compassion; and if a man confess that he is in any respectintemperate, he alleges love as an excuse for what is involuntary. But men donot imagine injustice to be at all There is also in jealousy, as they suppose,something involuntary; and for this reason they confess to jealousy also.    Living among such men, who are so confused so ignorant of what they say,and of evils which they have or have not, and why they have them, or how theyshall be relieved of them, I think it is worth the trouble for a man to watchconstantly "Whether I also am one of them, what imagination I have aboutmyself, how I conduct myself, whether I conduct myself as a prudent man,whether I conduct myself as a temperate man, whether I ever say this, that Ihave been taught to be prepared for everything that may happen. Have I theconsciousness, which a man who knows nothing ought to have, that I knownothing? Do I go to my teacher as men go to oracles, prepared to obey? or do Ilike a sniveling boy go to my school to learn history and understand the bookswhich I did not understand before, and, if it should happen so, to explain themalso to others?" Man, you have had a fight in the house with a poor slave, youhave turned the family upside down, you have frightened the neighbours, and youcome to me as if you were a wise man, and you take your seat and judge how Ihave explained some word, and how I have babbled whatever came into my head.You come full of envy, and humbled, because you bring nothing from home; andyou sit during, the discussion thinking of nothing else than how your father isdisposed toward you and your brother. "What are they saying about me there? nowthey think that I am improving, and are saying, 'He will return with allknowledge.' I wish I could learn everything before I return: but much labour isnecessary, and no one sends me anything, and the baths at Nicopolis are dirty;everything is bad at home, and bad here."    Then they say, "No one gains any profit from the school." Why, who comes tothe school, who comes for the purpose of being improved? who comes to presenthis opinions to he purified? who comes to learn what he is in want of? Why doyou wonder then if you carry back from the school the very things which youbring into it? For you come not to lay aside or to correct them or to receiveother principles in place of them. By no means, nor anything like it. Yourather look to this, whether you possess already that for which you come. Youwish to prattle about theorems? What then? Do you not become greater triflers?Do not your little theorems give you some opportunity of display? You solvesophistical syllogisms. Do you not examine the assumptions of the syllogismnamed "The Liar"? Do you not examine hypothetical syllogisms? Why, then, areyou still vexed if you receive the things for which you come to the school?"Yes; but if my child die or my brother, or if I must die or be racked, whatgood will these things do me?" Well, did you come for this? for this do you sitby my side? did you ever for this light your lamp or keep awake? or, when youwent out to the walking-place, did you ever propose any appearance that hadbeen presented to you instead of a syllogism, and did you and your friendsdiscuss it together? Where and when? Then you say, "Theorems are useless." Towhom? To such as make a bad use of them. For eyesalves are not useless to thosewho use them as they ought and when they ought. Fomentations are not useless.Dumb-bells are not useless; but they are useless to some, useful to others. Ifyou ask me now if syllogisms are useful, I will tell you that they are useful,and if you choose, I will prove it. "How then will they in any way be useful tome?" Man, did you ask if they are useful to you, or did you ask generally? Lethim who is suffering from dysentery ask me if vinegar is useful: I will saythat it is useful. "Will it then be useful to me?" I will say, "No." Seek firstfor the discharge to be stopped and the ulcers to be closed. And do you, O men,first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge; be tranquil in your mind, bringit free from distraction into the school, and you will know what power reasonhas.

<p>
On friendship
</p>

<p>
    What a man applies himself to earnestly, that he naturally loves. Do menthen apply themselves earnestly to the things which are bad? By no means. Well,do they apply themselves to things which in no way concern themselves? Not tothese either. It remains, then, that they employ themselves earnestly onlyabout things which are good; and if they are earnestly employed about things,they love such things also. Whoever, then, understands what is good, can alsoknow how to love; but he who cannot distinguish good from bad, and things whichare neither good nor bad from both, can he possess the power of loving? Tolove, then, is only in the power of the wise.    "How is this?" a man may say; am foolish, and yet love my child." I amsurprised indeed that you have begun by making the admission that you arefoolish. For what are you deficient in? Can you not make use of your senses? doyou not distinguish appearances? do you not use food which is suitable for yourbody, and clothing and habitation? Why then do you admit that you are foolish?It is in truth because you are often disturbed by appearances and perplexed,and their power of persuasion often conquers you; and sometimes you think thesethings to be good, and then the same things to be bad, and lastly neither goodnor bad; and in short you grieve, fear, envy, are disturbed, you are changed.This is the reason why you confess that you are foolish. And are you notchangeable in love? But wealth, and pleasure and, in a word, things themselves,do you sometimes think them to he good and sometimes bad? and do you not thinkthe same men at one time to be good, at another time bad? and have you not atone time a friendly feeling toward them and at another time the feeling of anenemy? and do you not at one time praise them and at another time blame them?"Yes; I have these feelings also." Well then, do you think that he who has beendeceived about a man is his friend? "Certainly not." And he who has selected aman as his friend and is of a changeable disposition, has he good-will towardhim? "He has not." And he who now abuses a man, and afterward admires him?"This man also has no good-will to the other." Well then, did you never seelittle dogs caressing and playing with one another, so that you might say thereis nothing more friendly? but, that you may know what friendship is, throw abit of flesh among them, and you will learn. Throw between yourself and yourson a little estate, and you will know how soon he will wish to bury you andhow soon you wish your son to die. Then you will change your tone and say,"What a son I have brought up! He has long been wishing to bury me." Throw asmart girl between you; and do you, the old man, love her, and the young onewill love her too, If a little fame intervene, or dangers, it will be just thesame. You will utter the words of the father of Admetus!       Life gives you pleasure: and why not your father.    Do you think that Admetus did not love his own child when he was little?that he was not in agony when the child had a fever? that he did not often say,"I wish I had the fever instead of the child?" then when the test (the thing)came and was near, see what words they utter. Were not Eteocles and Polynicesfrom the same mother and from the same father? Were they not brought uptogether, had they not lived together, drunk together, slept together, andoften kissed one another? So that, if any man, I think, had seen them, he wouldhave ridiculed the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter aboutfriendship. But when a quarrel rose between them about the royal power, asbetween dogs about a bit of meat, see what they say,       Polynices: Where will you take your station before the towers?       Eteocles: Why do you ask me this?       Polynices: I place myself opposite and try to kill you.       Eteocles: I also wish to do the same.Such are the wishes that they utter.    For universally, be not deceived, every animal is attached to nothing somuch as to its own interest. Whatever then appears to it an impediment to thisinterest, whether this be a brother, or a father, or a child, or beloved, orlover, it hates, spurns, curses: for its nature is to love nothing so much asits own interest; this is father, and brother and kinsman, and country, andGod. When, then, the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this, we abusethem and throw down their statues and burn their temples, as Alexander orderedthe temples of AEsculapius to be burned when his dear friend died.    For this reason if a man put in the same place his interest, sanctity,goodness, and country, and parents, and friends, all these are secured: but ifhe puts in one place his interest, in another his friends, and his country andhis kinsmen and justice itself, all these give way being borne down by theweight of interest. For where the "I" and the "Mine" are placed, to that placeof necessity the animal inclines: if in the flesh, there is the ruling power:if in the will, it is there: and if it is in externals, it is there. If then Iam there where my will is, then only shall I be a friend such as I ought to be,and son, and father; for this will he my interest, to maintain the character offidelity, of modesty, of patience, of abstinence, of active cooperation, ofobserving my relations. But if I put myself in one place, and honesty inanother, then the doctrine of Epicurus becomes strong, which asserts eitherthat there is no honesty or it is that which opinion holds to be honest.    It was through this ignorance that the Athenians and the Lacedaemoniansquarreled, and the Thebans with both; and the great king quarreled with Hellas,and the Macedonians with both; and the Romans with the Getae. And still earlierthe Trojan war happened for these reasons. Alexander was the guest of Menelaus;and if any man had seen their friendly disposition, he would not have believedany one who said that they were not friends. But there was cast between them abit of meat, a handsome woman, and about her war arose. And now when you seebrothers to be friends appearing to have one mind, do not conclude from thisanything about their friendship, not even if they say it and swear that it isimpossible for them to be separated from one another. For the ruling principleof a bad man cannot be trusted, it is insecure, has no certain rule by which itis directed, and is overpowered at different times by different appearances.But examine, not what other men examine, if they are born of the same parentsand brought up together, and under the same pedagogue; but examine this only,wherein they place their interest, whether in externals or in the will. If inexternals, do not name them friends, no more than name them trustworthy orconstant, or brave or free: do not name them even men, if you have anyjudgment. For that is not a principle of human nature which makes them bite oneanother, and abuse one another, and occupy deserted places or public places, asif they were mountains, and in the courts of justice display the acts ofrobbers; nor yet that which makes them intemperate and adulterers andcorrupters, nor that which makes them do whatever else men do against oneanother through this one opinion only, that of placing themselves and theirinterests in the things which are not within the power of their will. But ifyou hear that in truth these men think the good to be only there, where willis, and where there is a right use of appearances, no longer trouble yourselfwhether they are father or son, or brothers, or have associated a long time andare companions, but when you have ascertained this only, confidently declarethat they are friends, as you declare that they are faithful, that they arejust. For where else is friendship than where there is fidelity, and modesty,where there is a communion of honest things and of nothing else?    "But," you may say, "such a one treated me with regard so long; and did henot love me?" How do you know, slave, if he did not regard you in the same wayas he wipes his shoes with a sponge, or as he takes care of his beast? How doyou know, when you have ceased to be useful as a vessel, he will not throw youaway like a broken platter? "But this woman is my wife, and we have livedtogether so long." And how long did Eriphyle live with Amphiaraus, and was themother of children and of many? But a necklace came between them. "And what isa necklace?" It is the opinion about such things. That was the bestialprinciple, that was the thing which broke asunder the friendship betweenhusband and wife, that which did not allow the woman to be a wife nor themother to be a mother. And let every man among you who has seriously resolvedeither to be a friend himself or to have another for his friend, cut out theseopinions, hate them, drive them from his soul. And thus, first of all, he willnot reproach himself, he will not be at variance with himself, will not changehis mind, he will not torture himself. In the next place, to another also, whois like himself, he will be altogether and completely a friend. But he willbear with the man who is unlike himself, he will be kind to him, gentle, readyto pardon on account of his ignorance, on account of his being mistaken inthings of the greatest importance; but he will be harsh to no man, being wellconvinced of Plato's doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth unwillingly.If you cannot do this, yet you can do in all other respects as friends do,drink together, and lodge together, and sail together, and you may be born ofthe same parents; for snakes also are: but neither will they be friends noryou, so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinions.

<p>
On the power of speaking
</p>

<p>
    Every man will read a book with more pleasure or even with more case, if itis written in fairer characters. Therefore every man will also listen morereadily to what is spoken, if it is signified by appropriate and becomingwords. We must not say, then, that there is no faculty of expression: for thisaffirmation is the characteristic of an impious and also of a timid man. Of animpious man, because he undervalues the gifts which come from God, just as ifhe would take away the commodity of the power of vision, or of hearing, or ofseeing. Has, then, God given you eyes to no purpose? and to no purpose has heinfused into them a spirit so strong and of such skillful contrivance as toreach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are seen? Whatmessenger is so swift and vigilant? And to no purpose has he made theinterjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the vision penetratesthrough the atmosphere which is in a manner moved? And to no purpose has hemade light, without the presence of which there would be no use in any otherthing?    Man, be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget the things whichare superior to them. But indeed for the power of seeing and hearing, andindeed for life itself, and for the things which contribute to support it, forthe fruits which are dry, and for wine and oil give thanks to God: but rememberthat he has given you something else better than all these, I mean the power ofusing them, proving them and estimating the value of each. For what is thatwhich gives information about each of these powers, what each of them is worth?Is it each faculty itself? Did you ever hear the faculty of vision sayinganything about itself? or the faculty of hearing? or wheat, or barley, or ahorse or a dog? No; but they are appointed as ministers and slaves to serve thefaculty which has the power of making use of the appearances of things. And ifyou inquire what is the value of each thing, of whom do you inquire? whoanswers you? How then can any other faculty be more powerful than this, whichuses the rest as ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about them?for which of them knows what itself is, and what is its own value? which ofthem knows when it ought to employ itself and when not? what faculty is itwhich opens and closes the eyes, and turns them away from objects to which itought not to apply them and does apply them to other objects? Is it the facultyof vision? No; but it is the faculty of the will. What is that faculty whichcloses and opens the ears? what is that by which they are curious andinquisitive, or, on the contrary, unmoved by what is said? is it the faculty ofhearing? It is no other than the faculty of the will. Will this faculty then,seeing that it is amid all the other faculties which are blind and dumb andunable to see anything else except the very acts for which they are appointedin order to minister to this and serve it, but this faculty alone sees sharpand sees what is the value of each of the rest; will this faculty declare to usthat anything else is the best, or that itself is? And what else does the dowhen it is opened than see? But whether we ought to look on the wife of acertain person, and in what manner, who tells us? The faculty of the will. Andwhether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe it, and if we dobelieve, whether we ought to be moved by it or not, who tells us? Is it not thefaculty of the will? But this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words, ifthere is indeed any such peculiar faculty, what else does it do, when therehappens to be discourse about a thing, than to ornament the words and arrangethem as hairdressers do the hair? But whether it is better to speak or to besilent, and better to speak in this way or that way, and whether this isbecoming or not becoming and the season for each and the and the use, what elsetells us than the faculty of the will? Would you have it then to come forwardand condemn itself?    "What then," it says, "if the fact is so, can that which ministers besuperior to that to which it ministers, can the horse be superior to the rider,or the do, to the huntsman, or the instrument to the musician, or the servantsto the king?" What is that which makes use of the rest? The will. What takescare of all? The will. What destroys the whole man, at one time by hunger, atanother time by hanging, and at another time by a precipice? The will. Then isanything stronger in men than this? and how is it possible that the thingswhich are subject to restraint are stronger than that which is not What thingsare naturally formed to hinder the faculty of vision? Both will and thingswhich do not depend on the faculty of the will. It is the same with the facultyof hearing, with the faculty of speaking in like manner. But what has a naturalpower of hindering the will? Nothing which is independent of the will; but onlythe will itself, when it is perverted. Therefore this is alone vice or alonevirtue.    Then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest, let it comeforward and tell us that the most excellent of all things is the flesh. Noteven if the flesh itself declared that it is the most excellent, would anyperson bear that it should say this. But what is it, Epicurus, which pronouncesthis, which wrote about "The End of our Being," which wrote on "The Nature ofThings," which wrote about the Canon, which led you to wear a beard, whichwrote when it was dying that it was spending the last and a happy day? Was thisthe flesh or the will? Then do you admit that you possess anything superior tothis? and are you not mad? are you in fact so blind and deaf?    What then? Does any man despise the other faculties I hope not. Does anyman say that there is no use or excellence in the speaking faculty? I hope not.That would be foolish, impious, ungrateful toward God. But a man renders toeach thing its due value. For there is some use even in an ass, but not so muchas in an ox: there is also use in a dog, but not so much as in a slave: thereis also some use in a slave, but not so much as in citizens: there is also someuse in citizens, but riot so much as in magistrates. Not, indeed, because somethings are superior, must we undervalue the use which other things have. Thereis a certain value in the power of speaking, but it is not so great as thepower of the will. When, then, I speak thus, let no man think that I ask you toneglect the power of speaking, for neither do I ask you to neglect the eyes,nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet nor clothing nor shoes. But if you askme, "What, then, is the most excellent of all things?" what must I say? Icannot say the power of speaking, but the power of the will, when it is right.For it is this which uses the other, and all the other faculties both small andgreat. For when this faculty of the will is set right, a man who is not goodbecomes good: but when it falls, a man becomes bad. It is through this that weare unfortunate, that we are fortunate, that we blame one another, are pleasedwith one another. In a word, it is this which if neglect it makes unhappiness,and if we carefully look after it makes happiness.    But to take away the faculty of speaking, and to say that there is no suchfaculty in reality, is the act not only of an ungrateful man toward those whogave it, but also of a cowardly man: for such a person seems to me to fear ifthere is any faculty of this kind, that we shall not be able to despise it.Such also are those who say that there is no difference between beauty andugliness. Then it would happen that a man would be affected in the same way ifhe saw Thersites and if he saw Achilles; in the same way, if he saw Helen andany other woman. But these are foolish and clownish notions, and the notions ofmen who know not the nature of each thing, but are afraid, if a man shall seethe difference, that he shall immediately be seized and carried off vanquished.But this is the great matter; to leave to each thing the power which it has,and leaving to it this power to see what is the worth of the power, and tolearn what is the most excellent of all things, and to pursue this always, tobe diligent about this, considering t all other things of secondary valuecompared with this, but yet, as far as we can, not neglecting all those otherthings. For we must take care of the eyes also, not as if they were the mostexcellent thing, but we must take care of them on account of the most excellentthing, because it will not be in its true natural condition, if it does notrightly use the other faculties, and prefer some things to others.    What then is usually done? Men generally act as a traveler would do on hisway to his own country, when he enters a good inn, and being pleased with itshould remain there. Man, you have forgotten your purpose: you were nottraveling to this inn, but you were pass through it. "But this is a pleasantinn." And how many other inns are pleasant? and how many meadows are pleasant?yet only passing through. But your purpose is this, return to your country, torelieve your kinsmen of anxiety, to discharge the duties of a citizen, tomarry, to beget children, to fill the usual magistracies. For you are not cometo select more pleasant places, but to live in these where you were born and ofwhich you were made a citizen. Something of the kind takes place in the matterwhich we are considering. Since, by the aid of speech and such communication asyou receive here, you must advance to perfection, and purge your will, andcorrect the faculty which makes use of the appearances of things; and since itis necessary also for the teaching of theorems to be effected by a certain modeof expression and with a certain variety and sharpness, some persons captivatedby these very things abide in them, one captivated by the expression, anotherby syllogisms, another again by sophisms, and still another by some other innof the kind; and there they stay and waste away as if they were among Sirens.    Man, your purpose was to make yourself capable of using conformably tonature the appearances presented to you, in your desires not to be frustrated,in your aversion from things not to fall into that which you would avoid, neverto have no luck, nor ever to have bad luck, to be free, not hindered, notcompelled, conforming yourself to the administration of Zeus, obeying it, wellsatisfied with this, blaming no one, charging no one with fault, able from yourwhole soul to utter these verses:       "Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, too, Destiny."Then having this purpose before you, if some little form of expression pleasesyou, if some theorems please you, do you abide among them and choose t dwell owell there, forgetting the things at home, and do you say, "These things arefine"? Who says that they are not fine? but only as being a way home, as innsare. For what hinders you from being an unfortunate man, even if you speak likeDemosthenes? and what prevents you, if you can resolve syllogisms likeChrysippus, from being wretched, from sorrowing, from envying, in a word, frombeing disturbed, from being unhappy? Nothing. You see then that these wereinns, worth nothing; and that the purpose before you was something else. When Ispeak thus to some persons, they think that I am rejecting care about speaking,or care about theorems. I am not rejecting this care, but I am rejecting theabiding about these things incessantly and putting our hopes in them. If a manby this teaching does harm to those who listen to him, reckon me too amongthose who do this harm: for I am not able, when I see one thing which is mostexcellent and supreme, to say that another is so, in order to please you.

<p>
To a person who was one of those who was not valued by him
</p>

<p>
    A certain person said to him: "Frequently I desired to hear you and came toyou, and you never gave me any answer: and now, if it is possible, I entreatyou to say something to me." Do you think, said Epictetus, that as there is anart in anything else, so there is also an art in speaking, and that he who hasthe art, will speak skillfully, and he who has not, will speak unskillfully? "Ido think so." He, then, who by speaking receives benefit himself and is able tobenefit others, will speak skillfully: but he who is rather damaged by speakingand does damage to others, will he be unskilled in this art of speaking? Andyou may find that some are damaged and others benefited by speaking. And areall who hear benefited by what they hear? Or will you find that among them alsosome are benefited and some damaged? "There are both among these also," hesaid. In this case also, then, those who hear skillfully are benefited, andthose who hear unskillfully are damaged? He admitted this. Is there then askill in hearing also, as there is in speaking? "It seems so." If you choose,consider the matter in this way also. The practice of music, to whom does itbelong? "To a musician." And the proper making of a statue, to whom do youthink that it belongs? "To a statuary." And the looking at a statue skillfully,does this appear to you to require the aid of no art? "This also requires theaid of art." Then if speaking properly is the business of the skillful man, doyou see that to hear also with benefit is the business of the skillful man? Nowas to speaking and hearing perfectly, and usefully, let us for the present, ifyou please, say no more, for both of us are a long way from everything of thekind. But I think that every man will allow this, that he who is going to hearphilosophers requires some amount of practice in hearing. Is it not so?    Tell me then about what I should talk to you: about what matter are youable to listen? "About good and evil." Good and evil in what? In a horse? "No."Well, in an ox? "No." What then? In a man? "Yes." Do know then what a man is,what the notion is that we have of him, or have we our ears in any degreepracticed about this matter? But do you understand what nature is? or can youeven in any degree understand me when I say, "I shall use demonstration to you?" How? Do you understand this very thing, what demonstration is, or howanything is demonstrated, or by what means; or what things are likedemonstration, but are not demonstration? Do you know what is true or what isfalse? What is consequent on a thing, what is repugnant to a thing, or notconsistent, or inconsistent? But must I excite you to philosophy, and how?Shall I show to you the repugnance in the opinions of most men, through whichthey differ about things good and evil, and about things which are profitableand unprofitable, when you know not this very thing, what repugnance is? Showme then what I shall accomplish by discoursing with you; excite my inclinationto do this. As the grass which is suitable, when it is presented to a sheep,moves its inclination to eat, but if you present to it a stone or bread, itwill not be moved to eat; so there are in us certain natural inclinations alsoto speak, when the hearer shall appear to be somebody, when he himself shallexcite us: but when he shall sit by us like a stone or like grass, how can heexcite a man's desire? Does the vine say to the husbandman, "Take care of me?"No, but the vine by showing in itself that it will be profitable to thehusbandman, if he does take care of it, invites him to exercise care. Whenchildren are attractive and lively, whom do they not invite to play with them,and crawl with them, and lisp with them? But who is eager to play with an assor to bray with it? for though it is small, it is still a little ass.    "Why then do you say nothing to me?" I can only say this to you, that hewho knows not who he is, and for what purpose he exists, and what is thisworld, and with whom he is associated, and what things are the good and thebad, and the beautiful and the ugly, and who neither understands discourse nordemonstration, nor what is true nor what is false, and who is not able todistinguish them, will neither desire according to nature, nor turn away, normove upward, nor intend, nor assent, nor dissent, nor suspend his judgment: tosay all in a few words, he will go about dumb and blind, thinking that he issomebody, but being nobody. Is this so now for the first time? Is it not thefact that, ever since the human race existed, all errors and misfortunes havearisen through this ignorance? Why did Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel with oneanother? Was it not through not knowing what things are profitable and notprofitable? Does not the one say it is profitable to restore Chryseis to herfather, and does not the other say that it is not profitable? does not the onesay that he ought to take the prize of another, and does not the other say thathe ought not? Did they not for these reasons forget both who they were and forwhat purpose they had come there? Oh, man, for what purpose did you come? togain mistresses or to fight? "To fight." With whom? the Trojans or theHellenes? "With the Trojans." Do you then leave Hector alone and draw yoursword against your own king? And do you, most excellent Sir, neglect the dutiesof the king, you who are the people's guardian and have such cares; and are youquarreling about a little girl with the most warlike of your allies, whom youought by every means to take care of and protect? and do you become worse thana well-behaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators with all respect? Doyou see what kind of things ignorance of what is profitable does?    "But I also am rich." Are you then richer than Agamemnon? "But I am alsohandsome." Are you then more handsome than Achilles? "But I have also beautifulhair." But had not Achilles more beautiful hair and gold-colored? and he didnot comb it elegantly nor dress it. "But I am also strong." Can you then liftso great a stone as Hector or Ajax? "But I am also of noble birth." Are you theson of a goddess mother? are you the son of a father sprung from Zeus? Whatgood then do these things do to him, when he sits and weeps for a girl? "But Iam an orator." And was he not? Do you not see how he handled the most skillfulof the Hellenes in oratory, Odysseus and Phoenix? how he stopped their mouths?    This is all that I have to say to you; and I say even this not willingly."Why?" Because you have not roused me. For what must I look to in order to beroused, as men who are expert in are roused by generous horses? Must I look toyour body? You treat it disgracefully. To your dress? That is luxurious. Toyour behavior to your look? That is the same as nothing. When you would listento a philosopher, do not say to him, "You tell me nothing"; but only showyourself worthy of hearing or fit for hearing; and you will see how you willmove the speaker.

That logic is necessary
</p>

<p>
    When one of those who were present said, "Persuade me that logic isnecessary," he replied: Do you wish me to prove this to you? The answer was,"Yes." Then I must use a demonstrative form of speech. This was granted. Howthen will you know if I am cheating you by argument? The man was silent. Do yousee, said Epictetus, that you yourself are admitting that logic is necessary,if without it you cannot know so much as this, whether logic is necessary ornot necessary

<p>
What is the property of error
</p>

<p>
    Every error comprehends contradiction: for since he who errs does not wishto err, but to he right, it is plain that he does not do what he wishes. Forwhat does the thief wish to do? That which is for his own interest. If, then,the theft is not for his interest, he does not do that which he wishes. Butevery rational: soul is by nature offended at contradiction, and so long as itdoes not understand this contradiction, it is not hindered from doingcontradictory things: but when it does understand the contradiction, it must ofnecessity avoid the contradiction and avoid it as much as a man must dissentfrom the false when he sees that a thing is false; but so long as thisfalsehood does not appear to him, he assents to it as to truth.    He, then, is strong in argument and has the faculty of exhorting andconfuting, who is able to show to each man the contradiction through which heerrs and clearly to prove how he does not do that which he wishes and does thatwhich he does not wish. For if any one shall show this, a man will himselfwithdraw from that which he does; but so long as you do not show this, do notbe surprised if a man persists in his practice; for having the appearance ofdoing right, he does what he does. For this reason Socrates, also trusting tothis power, used to say, "I am used to call no other witness of what I say, butI am always satisfied with him with whom I am discussing, and I ask him to givehis opinion and call him as a witness, and through he is only one, he issufficient in the place of all." For Socrates knew by what the rational soul ismoved, just like a pair of scales, and that it must incline, whether it choosesor not. Show the rational governing faculty a contradiction, and it willwithdraw from it; but if you do not show it, rather blame yourself than him whois not persuaded.

BOOK THREE
</p>

<p>
Chapter 1
</p>

<p>
Of finery in dress
</p>

<p>
    A certain young man a rhetorician came to see Epictetus, with his hairdressed more carefully than was usual and his attire in an ornamental style;whereupon Epictetus said: Tell me you do not think that some dogs are beautifuland some horses, and so of all other animals. "I do think so," the youthreplied. Are not then some men also beautiful and others ugly? "Certainly." Dowe, then, for the same reason call each of them in the same kind beautiful, oreach beautiful for something peculiar? And you will judge of this matter thus.Since we see a dog naturally formed for one thing, and a horse for another, andfor another still, as an example, a nightingale, we may generally and notimproperly declare each of them to be beautiful then when it is most excellentaccording to its nature; but since the nature of each is different, each ofthem seems to me to be beautiful in a different way. Is it not so? He admittedthat it was. That then which makes a dog beautiful, makes a horse ugly; andthat which makes a horse beautiful, makes a dog ugly, if it is true that theirnatures are different. "It seems to be so." For I think that what makes apancratiast beautiful, makes a wrestler to be not good, and a runner to be mostridiculous; and he who is beautiful for the Pentathlon, is very ugly forwrestling. "It is so," said he. What, then, makes a man beautiful? Is thatwhich in its kind makes both a dog and a horse beautiful? "It is," he said.What then makes a dog beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a dog. Andwhat makes a horse beautiful? The possession of the excellence of a horse. Whatthen makes a man beautiful? Is it not the possession of the excellence of aman? And do you, then, if you wish to be beautiful, young man, labour at this,the acquisition of human excellence. But what is this? Observe whom youyourself praise, when you praise many persons without partiality: do you praisethe just or the unjust? "The just." Whether do you praise the moderate or theimmoderate? "The moderate." And the temperate or the intemperate? "Thetemperate." If, then, you make yourself such a person, you will know that youwill make yourself beautiful: but so long as you neglect these things, you mustbe ugly, even though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful.    Further I do not know what to say to you: for if I say to you what I think,I shall offend you, and you will perhaps leave the school and not return to it:and if I do not say what I think, see how I shall be acting, if you come to meto be improved, and I shall not improve you at all, and if you come to me as toa philosopher, and I shall say nothing to you as a philosopher. And how cruelit is to you to leave you uncorrected. If at any time afterward you shallacquire sense, you will with good reason blame me and say, "What did Epictetusobserve in me that, when he saw me in such a plight coming to him in such ascandalous condition, he neglected me and never said a word? did he so muchdespair of me? was I not young? was I not able to listen to reason? and howmany other young men at this age commit many like errors? I hear that a certainPolemon from being a most dissolute youth underwent such a great change. Well,suppose that he did not think that I should be a Polemon; yet he might have setmy hair right, he might have stripped off my decorations, he might have stoppedme from plucking the hair out of my body; but when he saw me dressed like- whatshall I say?- he kept silent." I do not say like what; but you will say, whenyou come to your senses and shall know what it is and what persons use such adress.    If you bring this charge against me hereafter, what defense shall I make?Why, shall I say that the man will not be persuaded by me? Was Laius persuadedby Apollo? Did he and get drunk and show no care for the oracle? Well then, forthis reason did Apollo refuse to tell him the truth? I indeed do not know,whether you will be persuaded by me or not; but Apollo knew most certainly thatLaius would not be persuaded and yet he spoke. But why did he speak? I say inreply: But why is he Apollo, and why does he deliver oracles, and why has hefixed himself in this place as a prophet and source of truth and for theinhabitants of the world to resort to him? and why are the words "Knowyourself" written in front of the temple, though no person takes any notice ofthem?    Did Socrates persuade all his hearers to take care of themselves? Not thethousandth part. But, however, after he had been placed in this position by thedeity, as he himself says, he never left it. But what does he say even to hisjudges? "If you acquit me on these conditions that I no longer do that which Ido now, I will not consent and I will not desist; but I will go up both toyoung and to old, and, to speak plainly, to every man whom I meet, and I willask the questions which I ask now; and most particularly will I do this to youmy fellow-citizens, because you are more nearly related to me." Are you socurious, Socrates, and such a busybody? and how does it concern you how we act?and what is it that you say? "Being of the same community and of the same kin,you neglect yourself, and show yourself a bad citizen to the state, and a badkinsman to your kinsmen, and a bad neighbor to your neighbors." "Who, then areyou?" Here it is a great thing to say, "I am he whose duty it is to take careof men; for it is not every little heifer which dares to resist a lion; but ifthe bull comes up and resists him, say to the bull, if you choose, 'And who areyou, and what business have you here?'" Man, in every kind there is producedsomething which excels; in oxen, in dogs, in bees, in horses. Do not then sayto that which excels, "Who, then, are you?" If you do, it will find a voice insome way and say, "I am such a thing as the purple in a garment: do not expectme to be like the others, or blame my nature that it has made me different fromthe rest of men."    What then? am I such a man? Certainly not. And are you such a man as canlisten to the truth? I wish you were. But however since in a manner I have beencondemned to wear a white beard and a cloak, and you come to me as to aphilosopher, I will not treat you in a cruel way nor yet as if I despaired ofyou, but I will say: Young man, whom do you wish to make beautiful? In thefirst place, know who you are and then adorn yourself appropriately. You are ahuman being; and this is a mortal animal which has the power of usingappearances rationally. But what is meant by "rationally?" Conformably tonature and completely. What, then, do you possess which is peculiar? Is it theanimal part? No. Is it the condition of mortality? No. Is it the power of usingappearances? No. You possess the rational faculty as a peculiar thing: adornand beautify this; but leave your hair to him who made it as he chose. Come,what other appellations have you? Are you man or woman? "Man." Adorn yourselfthen as man, not as woman. Woman is naturally smooth and delicate; and if shehas much hair (on her body), she is a monster and is exhibited at Rome amongmonsters. And in a man it is monstrous not to have hair; and if he has no hair,he is a monster; but if he cuts off his hairs and plucks them out, what shallwe do with him? where shall we exhibit him? and under what name shall we showhim? "I will exhibit to you a man who chooses to be a woman rather than a man."What a terrible sight! There is no man who will not wonder at such a notice.Indeed I think that the men who pluck out their hairs do what they do withoutknowing what they do. Man what fault have you to find with your nature? That itmade you a man? What then? was it fit that nature should make all humancreatures women? and what advantage in that case would you have had in beingadorned? for whom would you have adorned yourself, if all human creatures werewomen? But you are not pleased with the matter: set to work then upon the wholebusiness. Take away- what is its name?- that which is the cause of the hairs:make yourself a woman in all respects, that we may not be mistaken: do not makeone half man, and the other half woman. Whom do you wish to please? The women?,Please them as a man. "Well; but they like smooth men." Will you not hangyourself? and if women took delight in catamites, would you become one? Is thisyour business? were you born for this purpose, that dissolute women shoulddelight in you? Shall we make such a one as you a citizen of Corinth andperchance a prefect of the city, or chief of the youth, or general orsuperintendent of the games? Well, and when you have taken a wife, do youintend to have your hairs plucked out? To please whom and for what purpose? Andwhen you have begotten children, will you introduce them also into the statewith the habit of plucking their hairs? A beautiful citizen, and senator andrhetorician. We ought to pray that such young men be born among us and broughtup.
    Do not so, I entreat you by the Gods, young man: but when you have onceheard these words, go away and say to yourself, "Epictetus has not said this tome; for how could he? but some propitious good through him: for it would neverhave come into his thoughts to say this, since he is not accustomed to talkthus with any person. Come then let us obey God, that we may not be subject tohis anger." You say, "No." But, if a crow by his croaking signifies anything toyou, it is not the crow which signifies, but God through the crow; and if hesignifies anything through a human voice, will he not cause the man to say thisto you, that you may know the power of the divinity, that he signifies to somein this way, and to others in that way, and concerning the greatest things andthe chief he signifies through the noblest messenger? What else is it which thepoet says:       For we ourselves have warned him, and have sent       Hermes the careful watcher, Argus' slayer,       The husband not to kill nor wed the wife.    Was Hermes going to descend from heaven to say this to him? And now theGods say this to you and send the messenger, the slayer of Argus, to warn younot to pervert that which is well arranged, nor to busy yourself about it, butto allow a man to be a man, and a woman to be a woman, a beautiful man to be asa beautiful man, and an ugly man as an ugly man, for you are not flesh andhair, but you are will; and if your will beautiful, then you will be beautiful.But up the present time I dare not tell you that you are ugly, for I think thatyou are readier to hear anything than this. But see what Socrates says to themost beautiful and blooming of men Alcibiades: "Try, then, to be beautiful."What does he say to him? "Dress your hair and pluck the hairs from your legs."Nothing of that kind. But "Adorn your will, take away bad opinions." "How withthe body?" Leave it as it is by nature. Another has looked after these things:intrust them to him. "What then, must a man be uncleaned?" Certainly not; butwhat you are and are made by nature, cleanse this. A man should be cleanly as aman, a woman as a woman, a child as a child. You say no: but let us also pluckout the lion's mane, that he may not be uncleaned, and the cock's comb for healso ought to he cleaned. Granted, but as a cock, and the lion as a lion, andthe hunting dog as a hunting dog.

Chapter 2
</p>

<p>
In what a man ought to be exercised who has made proficiency; and that we                           neglect the chief things
</p>

<p>
    There are three things in which a man ought to exercise himself who wouldbe wise and good. The first concerns the desires and the aversions, that a manmay not fail to get what he desires, and that he may not fall into that whichhe does not desire. The second concerns the movements (toward) and themovements from an object, and generally in doing what a man ought to do, thathe may act according to order, to reason, and not carelessly. The third thingconcerns freedom from deception and rashness in judgement, and generally itconcerns the assents. Of these topics the chief and the most urgent is thatwhich relates to the affects; for an affect is produced in no other way than bya failing to obtain that which a man desires or a falling into that which a manwould wish to avoid. This is that which brings in perturbations, disorders, badfortune, misfortunes, sorrows, lamentations and envy; that which makes menenvious and jealous; and by these causes we are unable even to listen to theprecepts of reason. The second topic concerns the duties of a man; for I oughtnot to be free from affects like a statue, but I ought to maintain therelations natural and acquired, as a pious man, as a son, as a father, as acitizen.    The third topic is that which immediately concerns those who are makingproficiency, that which concerns the security of the other two, so that noteven in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise us, nor in intoxication,nor in melancholy. "This," it may be said, "is above our power." But thepresent philosophers neglecting the first topic and the second, employthemselves on the third, using sophistical arguments, making conclusions fromquestioning, employing hypotheses, lying. "For a man must," as it is said,"when employed on these matters, take care that he is not deceived." Who must?The wise and good man. This then is all that is wanting to you. Have yousuccessfully worked out the rest? Are you free from deception in the matter ofmoney? If you see a beautiful girl, do you resist the appearance? If yourneighbor obtains an estate by will, are you not vexed? Now is there nothingelse wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of mind? Wretch, you hearthese very things with fear and anxiety that some person may despise you, andwith inquiries about what any person may say about you. And if a man come andtell you that in a certain conversation in which the question was, "Who is thebest philosopher," a man who was present said that a certain person was thechief philosopher, your little soul which was only a finger's length stretchesout to two cubits. But if another who is present "You are mistaken; it is notworth while to listen to a certain person, for what does he know? he has onlythe first principles, and no more?" then you are confounded, you grow pale, youcry out immediately, "I will show him who I am, that I am a great philosopher."It is seen by these very things: why do you wish to show it by others? Do younot know that Diogenes pointed out one of the sophists in this way bystretching out his middle finger? And then when the man was wild with rage,"This," he said, "is the certain person: I pointed him out to you." For a manis not shown by the finger, as a stone or a piece of wood: but when any personshows the man s principles, then he shows him as a man.    Let us look at your principles also. For is it not plain that you value notat all your own will, but you look externally to things which are independentof your will? For instance, what will a certain person say? and what willpeople think of you? will you be considered a man of learning; have you readChrysippus or Antipater? for if you have read Archedemus also, you haveeverything. Why are you still uneasy lest you should not show us who you are?Would you let me tell you what manner of man you have shown us that you are?You have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow, querulous, passionate,cowardly, finding fault with everything, blaming everybody, never quiet, vain:this is what you have exhibited to us. Go away now and read Archedemus; then,if a mouse should leap down and make a noise, you are a dead man. For such adeath awaits you as it did- what was the man's name?- Crinis; and he too wasproud, because he understood Archedemus.    Wretch, will you not dismiss these things that do not concern you at all?These things are suitable to those who are able to learn them withoutperturbation, to those who can say: "I am not subject to anger, to grief, toenvy: I am not hindered, I am not restrained. What remains for me? I haveleisure, I am tranquil: let us see how we must deal with sophistical arguments;let us see how when a man has accepted an hypothesis he shall not be led awayto anything absurd." To them such things belong. To those who are happy it isappropriate to light a fire, to dine; if they choose, both to sing and todance. But when the vessel is sinking, you come to me and hoist the sails.

</p>

<p>
What is the matter on which a good man should he employed, and in what we ought                         chiefly to practice ourselves
</p>

<p>
    The material for the wise and good man is his own ruling faculty: and thebody is the material for the physician and the aliptes; the land is the matterfor the husbandman. The business of the wise and good man is to use appearancesconformably to nature: and as it is the nature of every soul to assent to thetruth, to dissent from the false, and to remain in suspense as to that which isuncertain; so it is its nature to be moved toward the desire of the good, andto aversion from the evil; and with respect to that which is neither good norbad it feels indifferent. For as the money-changer is not allowed to rejectCaesar's coin, nor the seller of herbs, but if you show the coin, whether hechooses or not, he must give up what is sold for the coin; so it is also in thematter of the soul. When the good appears, it immediately attracts to itself;the evil repels from itself. But the soul will never reject the manifestappearance of the good, any more than persons will reject Caesar's coin. Onthis principle depends every movement both of man and God.    For this reason the good is preferred to every intimate relationship. Thereis no intimate relationship between me and my father, but there is between meand the good. "Are you so hard-hearted?" Yes, for such is my nature; and thisis the coin which God has given me. For this reason, if the good is somethingdifferent from the beautiful and the just, both father is gone, and brother andcountry, and everything. But shall I overlook my own good, in order that youmay have it, and shall I give it up to you? Why? "I am your father." But youare not my good. "I am your brother." But you are not my good. But if we placethe good in a right determination of the will, the very observance of therelations of life is good, and accordingly he who gives up any external thingsobtains that which is good. Your father takes away your property. But he doesnot injure you. Your brother will have the greater part of the estate in land.Let him have as much as he chooses. Will he then have a greater share ofmodesty, of fidelity, of brotherly affection? For who will eject you from thispossession? Not even Zeus, for neither has he chosen to do so; but he has madethis in my own power, and he has given it to me just as he possessed ithimself, free from hindrance, compulsion, and impediment. When then the coinwhich another uses is a different coin, if a man presents this coin, hereceives that which is sold for it. Suppose that there comes into the provincea thievish proconsul, what coin does he use? Silver coin. Show it to him, andcarry off what you please. Suppose one comes who is an adulterer: what coindoes he use? Little girls. "Take," a man says, "the coin, and sell me the smallthing." "Give," says the seller, "and buy." Another is eager to possess boys.Give him the coin, and receive what you wish. Another is fond of hunting: givehim a fine nag or a dog. Though he groans and laments, he will sell for it thatwhich you want. For another compels him from within, he who has fixed thiscoin.    Against this kind of thing chiefly a man should exercise himself. As soonas you go out in the morning, examine every man whom you see, every man whomyou hear; answer as to a question, "What have you seen?" A handsome man orwoman? Apply the rule: Is this independent of the will, or dependent?Independent. Take it away. What have you seen? A man lamenting over the deathof a child. Apply the rule. Death is a thing independent of the will. Take itaway. Has the proconsul met you? Apply the rule. What kind of thing is aproconsul's office? Independent of the will, or dependent on it? Independent.Take this away also: it does not stand examination: cast it away: it is nothingto you.    If we practiced this and exercised ourselves in it daily from morning tonight, something indeed would be done. But now we are forthwith caughthalf-asleep by every appearance, and it is only, if ever, that in the school weare roused a little. Then when we go out, if we see a man lamenting, we say,"He is undone." If we see a consul, we say, "He is happy." If we see an exiledman, we say, "He is miserable." If we see a poor man, we say, "He is wretched:he has nothing to eat."    We ought then to eradicate these bad opinions, and to this end we shoulddirect all our efforts. For what is weeping and lamenting? Opinion. What is badfortune? Opinion. What is civil sedition, what is divided opinion, what isblame, what is accusation, what is impiety, what is trifling? All these thingsare opinions, and nothing more, and opinions about things independent of thewill, as if they were good and bad. Let a man transfer these opinions to thingsdependent on the will, and I engage for him that he will be firm and constant,whatever may be the state of things around him. Such as is a dish of water,such is the soul. Such as is the ray of light which falls on the water, suchare the appearances. When the water is moved, the ray also seems to be moved,yet it is not moved. And when, then, a man is seized with giddiness, it is notthe arts and the virtues which are confounded, but the spirit on which they areimpressed; but if the spirit be restored to its settled state, those thingsalso are restored.

Against a person who showed his partisanship in an unseemly way in a theatre
</p>

<p>
    The governor of Epirus having shown his favor to an actor in an unseemlyway and being publicly blamed on this account, and afterward having reported toEpictetus that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those who blamed him,Epictetus said: What harm have they been doing? These men also were acting, aspartisans, as you were doing. The governor replied, "Does, then, any personshow his partisanship in this way?" When they see you, said Epictetus, who aretheir governor, a friend of Caesar and his deputy, showing partisanship in thisway, was it not to be expected that they also should show their partisanship inthe same way? for if it is not right to show partisanship in this way, do notdo so yourself; and if it is right, why are you angry if they followed yourexample? For whom have the many to imitate except you, who are their superiors,to whose example should they look when they go to the theatre except yours?"See how the deputy of Caesar looks on: he has cried out, and I too, then, willcry out. He springs up from his seat, and I will spring up. His slaves sit invarious parts of the theatre and call out. I have no slaves, but I will myselfcry out as much as I can and as loud as all of them together." You ought thento know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a rule and example to therest how they ought to look at the acting. Why then did they blame you? Becauseevery man hates that which is a hindrance to him. They wished one person to becrowned; you wished another. They were a hindrance to you, and you were ahindrance to them. You were found to be the stronger; and they did what theycould; they blamed that which hindered them. What, then, would you have? Thatyou should do what you please, and they should not even say what they please?And what is the wonder? Do not the husbandmen abuse Zeus when they are hinderedby him? do not the sailors abuse him? do they ever cease abusing Caesar? Whatthen does not Zeus know? is not what is said reported to Caesar? What, then,does he do? he knows that, if he punished all who abuse him, he would havenobody to rule over. What then? when you enter the theatre, you ought to saynot, "Let Sophron be crowned", but you ought to say this, "Come let me maintainmy will in this matter so that it shall be conformable to nature: no man isdearer to me than myself. It would be ridiculous, then, for me to be hurt(injured) in order that another who is an actor may be crowned." Whom then do Iwish to gain the prize? Why the actor who does gain the prize; and so he willalways gain the prize whom I wish to gain it. "But I wish Sophron to becrowned." Celebrate as many games as you choose in your own house, Nemean,Pythian, Isthmian, Olympian, and proclaim him victor. But in public do notclaim more than your due, nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what belongsto all. If you do not consent to this, bear being abused: for when you do thesame as the many, you put yourself on the same level with them.

Against those who on account of sickness go away home
</p>

<p>
    "I am sick here," said one of the pupils, "and I wish to return home." Athome, I suppose, you free from sickness. Do you not consider whether you aredoing, anything here which may be useful to the exercise of your will, that itmay be corrected? For if you are doing nothing toward this end, it was to nopurpose that you came. Go away. Look after your affairs at home. For if yourruling power cannot be maintained in a state conformable to nature, it ispossible that your land can, that you will he able to increase your money, youwill take care of your father in his old age, frequent the public place, holdmagisterial office: being bad you will do badly anything else that you have todo. But if you understand yourself, and know that you are casting away certainbad opinions and adopting others in their place, and if you have changed yourstate of life from things which are not within your will to things which arewithin your will, and if you ever say, "Alas!" you are not saying what you sayon account of your father, or your brother, but on account of yourself, do youstill allege your sickness? Do you not know that both disease and death mustsurprise us while we are doing something? the husbandman while he is tillingthe ground, the sailor while he is on his voyage? what would you be doing whendeath surprises you, for you must be surprised when you are doing something? Ifyou can be doing anything better than this when you are surprised, do it. For Iwish to be surprised by disease or death when I am looking after nothing elsethan my that may be free from perturbation, own will that I may be free fromhindrance, free from compulsion, and in a state of liberty. I wish to be foundpracticing these things that I may be able to say to God, "Have I in anyrespect transgressed thy commands? have I in any respect wrongly used thepowers which Thou gavest me? have I misused my perceptions or mypreconceptions? have I ever blamed Thee? have I ever found fault with Thyadministration? I have been sick, because it was Thy will, and so have others,but I was content to be sick. I have been poor because it was Thy will, but Iwas content also. I have not filled a magisterial office, because it was notThy pleasure that I should: I have never desired it. Hast Thou ever seen me forthis reason discontented? have I not always approached Thee with a cheerfulcountenance, ready to do Thy commands and to obey Thy signals? Is it now Thywill that I should depart from the assemblage of men? I depart. I give Thee allthanks that Thou hast allowed me to join in this Thy assemblage of men and tosee Thy works, and to comprehend this Thy administration." May death surpriseme while I am thinking of these things, while I am thus writing and reading.    "But my mother will not hold my head when I am sick." Go to your motherthen; for you are a fit person to have your head held when you are sick. "Butat home I used to lie down on a delicious bed." Go away to your bed: indeed youare fit to lie on such a bed even when you are in health: do not, then, losewhat you can do there.    But what does Socrates say? "As one man," he says, "is pleased withimproving his land, another with improving his horse, so I am daily pleased inobserving that I am growing better." "Better in what? in using nice littlewords?" Man, do not say that. "In little matters of speculation?" What are yousaying? "And indeed I do not see what else there is on which philosophersemploy their time." Does it seem nothing to you to have never found fault withany person, neither with God nor man? to have blamed nobody? to carry the sameface always in going out and coming in? This is what Socrates knew, and yet henever said that he knew anything or taught anything. But if any man asked fornice little words or little speculations, he would carry him to Protagoras orto Hippias; and if any man came to ask for pot-herbs, he would carry him to thegardener. Who then among you has this purpose? for if indeed you had it, youwould both be content in sickness, and in hunger, and in death. If any amongyou has been in love with a charming girl, he knows that I say what is true.

Miscellaneous

<p>
    When some person asked him how it happened that since reason has been morecultivated by the men of the present age, the progress made in former times wasgreater. In what respect, he answered, has it been more cultivated now, and inwhat respect was the progress greater then? For in that in which it has nowbeen more cultivated, in that also the progress will now be found. At presentit has been cultivated for the purpose of resolving syllogisms, and progress ismade. But in former times it was cultivated for the purpose of maintaining thegoverning faculty in a condition conformable to nature, and progress was made.Do not, then, mix things which are different and do not expect, when you arelaboring at one thing, to make progress in another. But see if any man among uswhen he is intent see I upon this, the keeping himself in a state conformableto nature and living so always, does not make progress. For you will not findsuch a man.    The good man is invincible, for he does not enter the contest where he isnot stronger. If you want to have his land and all that is on it, take theland; take his slaves, take his magisterial office, take his poor body. But youwill not make his desire fail in that which it seeks, nor his aversion fallinto that which he would avoid. The only contest into which he enters is thatabout things which are within the power of his will; how then will he not beinvincible?    Some person having asked him what is Common sense, Epictetus replied: Asthat may be called a certain Common hearing which only distinguishes vocalsounds, and that which distinguishes musical sounds is not Common, butartificial; so there are certain things which men, who are not altogetherperverted, see by the common notions which all possess. Such a constitution ofthe mind is named Common sense.    It is not easy to exhort weak young men; for neither is it easy to holdcheese with a hook. But those who have a good natural disposition, even if youtry to turn them aside, cling still more to reason. Wherefore Rufus generallyattempted to discourage, and he used this method as a test of those who had agood natural disposition and those who had not. "For," it was his habit to say,"as a stone, if you cast it upward, will be brought down to the earth by itsown nature, so the man whose mind is naturally good, the more you repel him,the more he turns toward that to which he is naturally inclined."

To the administrator of the free cities who was an Epicurean
</p>

<p>
    When the administrator came to visit him, and the man was an Epicurean,Epictetus said: It is proper for us who are not philosophers to inquire of youwho are philosophers, as those who come to a strange city inquire of thecitizens and those who are acquainted with it, what is the best thing in theworld, in order that we also, after inquiry, may go in quest of that which isbest and look at it, as strangers do with the things in cities. For that thereare three things which relate to man, soul, body, and things external, scarcelyany man denies. It remains for you philosophers to answer what is the best.What shall we say to men? Is the flesh the best? and was it for this thatMaximus sailed as far as Cassiope in winter with his son, and accompanied himthat he might be gratified in the flesh? Then the man said that it was not, andadded, "Far be that from him." Is it not fit then, Epictetus said, to beactively employed about the best? "It is certainly of all things the most fit."What, then, do we possess which is better than the flesh? "The soul," hereplied. And the good things of the best, are they better, or the good thingsof the worse? "The good things of the best." And are the good things of thebest within the power of the will or not within the power of the will? "Theyare within the power of the will." Is, then, the pleasure of the soul a thingwithin the power of the will? "It is," he replied. And on what shall thispleasure depend? On itself? But that cannot be conceived: for there must firstexist a certain substance or nature of good, by obtaining which we shall havepleasure in the soul. He assented to this also. On what, then, shall we dependfor this pleasure of the soul? for if it shall depend on things of the soul,the substance of the good is discovered; for good cannot be one thing, and thatat which we are rationally delighted another thing; nor if that which precedesis not good, can that which comes after be good, for in order that the thingwhich comes after may be good, that which precedes must be good. But you wouldnot affirm this, if you are in your right mind, for you would then say what isinconsistent both with Epicurus and the rest of your doctrines. It remains,then, that the pleasure of the soul is in the pleasure from things of the body:and again that those bodily things must be the things which precede and thesubstance of the good.    For this reason Maximus acted foolishly if he made the voyage for any otherreason than for the sake of the flesh, that is, for the sake of the best. Andalso a man acts foolishly if he abstains from that which belongs to others,when he is a judge and able to take it. But, if you please, let us considerthis only, how this thing may be done secretly, and safely, and so that no manwill know it. For not even does Epicurus himself declare stealing to be bad,but he admits that detection is; and because it is impossible to have securityagainst detection, for this reason he says, "Do not steal." But I say to youthat if stealing is done cleverly and cautiously, we shall not be detected:further also we have powerful friends in Rome both men and women, and theHellenes are weak, and no man will venture to go up to Rome for the purpose.Why do you refrain from your own good? This is senseless, foolish. But even ifyou tell me that you do refrain, I will not believe you. For as it isimpossible to assent to that which appears false, and to turn away from thatwhich is true, so it is impossible to abstain from that which appears good. Butwealth is a good thing, and certainly most efficient in producing pleasure. Whywill you not acquire wealth? And why should we not corrupt our neighbor's wife,if we can do it without detection? and if the husband foolishly prates aboutthe matter, why not pitch him out of the house? If you would be a philosophersuch as you ought to be, if a perfect philosopher, if consistent with your owndoctrines. If you would not, you will not differ at all from us who are calledStoics; for we also say one thing, but we do another: we talk of the thingswhich are beautiful, but we do what is base. But you will be perverse in thecontrary way, teaching what is bad, practicing what is good.    In the name of God, are you thinking of a city of Epicureans? "I do notmarry." "Nor I, for a man ought not to marry; nor ought we to beget children,nor engage in public matters." What then will happen? whence will the citizenscome? who will bring them up? who will be governor of the youth, who preside wiover gymnastic exercises? and in what also will the teacher instruct them? willhe teach them what the Lacedaemonians were taught, or what the Athenians weretaught? Come take a young man, bring him up according to your doctrines. Thedoctrines are bad, subversive of a state, pernicious to families, and notbecoming to women. Dismiss them, man. You live in a chief city: it is your dutyto be a magistrate, to judge justly, to abstain from that which belongs toothers; no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own wife, and noyouth, no vessel of silver, no vessel of gold. Seek for doctrines which areconsistent with what I say, and, by making them your guide, you will withpleasure abstain from things which have such persuasive power to lead us andoverpower us. But if to the persuasive power of these things, we also devisesuch a philosophy as this which helps to push us on toward them and strengthensus to this end, what will be the consequence? In a piece of toreutic art whichis the best part? the silver or the workmanship? The substance of the hand isthe flesh; but the work of the hand is the principal part. The duties then arealso three; those which are directed toward the existence of a thing; thosewhich are directed toward its existence in a particular kind; and third, thechief or leading things themselves. So also in man we ought not to value thematerial, the poor flesh, but the principal. What are these? Engaging in publicbusiness, marrying, begetting children, venerating God, taking care of parents,and, generally, having desires, aversions, pursuits of things and avoidances,in the way in which we ought to do these things, and according to our nature.And how are we constituted by nature? Free, noble, modest: for what otheranimal blushes? what other is capable of receiving the appearance of shame? andwe are so constituted by nature as to subject pleasure to these things, as aminister, a servant, in order that it may call forth our activity, in orderthat it may keep us constant in acts which are conformable to nature.    "But I am rich and I want nothing." Why, then, do you pretend to be aphilosopher? Your golden and your silver vessels are enough for you. What needhave you of principles? "But I am also a judge of the Greeks." Do you know howto judge? Who taught you to know? "Caesar wrote to me a codicil." Let him writeand give you a commission to judge of music; and what will be the use of it toyou? Still how did you become a judge? whose hand did you kiss? the hand ofSymphorus or Numenius? Before whose bedchamber have you slept? To whom have yousent gifts? Then do you not see that to be a judge is just of the same value asNumenius is? "But I can throw into prison any man whom I please." So you can dowith a stone. "But I can beat with sticks whom I please." So you may an ass.This is not a governing of men. Govern us as rational animals: show us what isprofitable to us, and we will follow it: show us what is unprofitable, and wewill turn away from it. Make us imitators of yourself, as Socrates made menimitators of himself. For he was like a governor of men, who made them subjectto him their desires, their aversion, their movements toward an object andtheir turning away from it. "Do this: do not do this: if you do not obey, Iwill throw you into prison." This is not governing men like rational animals.But I: As Zeus has ordained, so act: if you do not act so, you will feel thepenalty, you will be punished. What will be the punishment? Nothing else thannot having done your duty: you will lose the character of fidelity, modesty,propriety. Do not look for greater penalties than these.

To a certain rhetorician who was going up to Rome on a suit
</p>

<p>
    When a certain person came to him, who was going up to Rome on account of asuit which had regard to his rank, Epictetus inquired the reason of his goingto Rome, and the man then asked what he thought about the matter. Epictetusreplied: If you ask me what you will do in Rome, whether you will succeed orfall, I have no rule about this. But if you ask me how you will fare, I cantell you: if you have right opinions, you will fare well; if they are false,you will fare ill. For to every man the cause of his acting is opinion. Forwhat is the reason why you desired to be elected governor of the Cnossians?Your opinion. What is the reason that you are now going up to Rome? Youropinion. And going in winter, and with danger and expense. "I must go." Whattells you this? Your opinion. Then if opinions are the causes of all actions,and a man has bad opinions, such as the cause may be, such also is the effect.Have we then all sound opinions, both you and your adversary? And how do youdiffer? But have you sounder opinions than your adversary? Why? You think so.And so does he think that his opinions are better; and so do madmen. This is abad criterion. But show to me that you have made some inquiry into youropinions and have taken some pains about them. And as now you are sailing toRome in order to become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not content tostay at home with the honors which you had, but you desire something greaterand more conspicuous, so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose ofexamining your own opinions, and casting them out, if you have any that arebad? Whom have you approached for this purpose? What time have you fixed forit? What age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if you are ashamed ofme. When you were a boy, did you examine your own opinions? and did you notthen, as you do all things now, do as you did do? and when you were become ayouth and attended the rhetoricians, and yourself practiced rhetoric, what didyou imagine that you were deficient in? And when you were a young man andengaged in public matters, and pleaded causes yourself, and were gainingreputation, who then seemed your equal? And when would you have submitted toany man examining and show that your opinions are bad? What, then, do you wishme to say to you? "Help me in this matter." I have no theorem (rule) for this.Nor have you, if you came to me for this purpose, come to me as a philosopher,but as to a seller of vegetables or a shoemaker. "For what purpose then havephilosophers theorems?" For this purpose, that whatever may happen, our rulingfaculty may be and continue to be conformable to nature. Does this seem to youa small thing? "No; but the greatest." What then? does it need only a shorttime? and is it possible to seize it as you pass by? If you can, seize it.    Then you will say, "I met with Epictetus as I should meet with a stone or astatue": for you saw me, and nothing more. But he meets with a man as a man,who learns his opinions, and in his turn shows his own. Learn my opinions: showme yours; and then say that you have visited me. Let us examine one another: ifI have any bad opinion, take it away; if you have any, show it. This is themeaning of meeting with a philosopher. "Not so, but this is only a passingvisit, and while we are hiring the vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let ussee what he says." Then you go away and say: "Epictetus was nothing: he usedsolecisms and spoke in a barbarous way." For of what else do you come asjudges? "Well, but a man may say to me, "If I attend to such matters, I shallhave no land, as you have none; I shall have no silver cups as you have none,nor fine beasts as you have none." In answer to this it is perhaps sufficientto say: I have no need of such things: but if you possess many things you haveneed of others: whether you choose or not, you are poorer than I am. "What thenhave I need of?" Of that which you have not: of firmness, of a mind which isconformable to nature, of being free from perturbation. Whether I have a patronor not, what is that to me? but it is something to you. I am richer than you: Iam not anxious what Caesar will think of me: for this reason, I flatter no man.This is what I possess instead of vessels of silver and gold. You have utensilsof gold; but your discourse, your opinions, your assents, your movements, yourdesires are of earthen ware. But when I have these things conformable tonature, why should I not employ my studies also upon reason? for I haveleisure: my mind is not distracted. What shall I do, since I have nodistraction? What more suitable to a man have I than this? When you havenothing to do, you are disturbed, you go to the theatre or you wander aboutwithout a purpose. Why should not the philosopher labour to improve his reason?You employ yourself about crystal vessels: I employ myself about the syllogismnamed "The Living": you about myrrhine vessels; I employ myself about thesyllogism named "The Denying." To you everything appears small that youpossess: to me all that I have appears great. Your desire is insatiable: mineis satisfied. To (children) who put their hand into a narrow necked earthenvessel and bring out figs and nuts, this happens; if they fill the hand, theycannot take it out, and then they cry. Drop a few of them and you will drawthings out. And do you part with your desires: do not desire many things andyou will have what you want.

In what manner we ought to bear sickness
</p>

<p>
    When the need of each opinion comes, we ought to have it in readiness: onthe occasion of breakfast, such as relate to breakfast; in the bath, those thatconcern the bath; in bed, those that concern bed.       Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes       Before each daily action thou hast scann'd;       What's done amiss, what done, what left undone;       From first to last examine all, and then       Blame what is wrong in what is right rejoice.    And we ought to retain these verses in such way that we may use them, notthat we may utter them aloud, as when we exclaim "Paean Apollo." Again in feverwe should have ready such opinions as concern a fever; and we ought not, assoon as the fever begins, to lose and forget all. (A man who has a fever) may"If I philosophize any longer, may I be hanged: wherever I go, I must take careof the poor body, that a fever may not come." But what is philosophizing? Is itnot a preparation against events which may happen? Do you not understand thatyou are saying something of this kind? "If I shall still prepare myself to bearwith patience what happens, may I be hanged." But this is just as if a manafter receiving blows should give up the Pancratium. In the Pancratium it is inour power to desist and not to receive blows. But in the other matter, we giveup philosophy, what shall we gain I gain? What then should a man say on theoccasion of each painful thing? "It was for this that I exercised myself, forthis I disciplined myself." God says to you, "Give me a proof that you haveduly practiced athletics, that you have eaten what you ought, that you havebeen exercised, that you have obeyed the aliptes." Then do you show yourselfweak when the time for action comes? Now is the time for the fever. Let it beborne well. Now is the time for thirst, well; now is the time for hunger, bearit well. Is it not in your power? who shall hinder you? The physician willhinder you from drinking; but he cannot prevent you from bearing thirst well:and he will hinder you from eating; but he cannot prevent you from bearinghunger well.    "But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies." And for what purpose doyou follow them? Slave, is it not that you may be happy, that you may beconstant, is it not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and liveso? What hinders you when you have a fever from having your ruling facultyconformable to nature? Here is the proof of the thing, here is the test of thephilosopher. For this also is a part of life, like walking, like sailing, likejourneying by land, so also is fever. Do you read when you are walking? No. Nordo you when you have a fever. if you walk about well, you have all that belongsto a man who walks. If you bear fever well, you have all that belongs to a manin a fever. What is it to bear a fever well? Not to blame God or man; not to beafflicted it that which happens, to expect death well and nobly, to do whatmust be done: when the physician comes in, not to be frightened at what hesays; nor if he says, "You are doing well," to be overjoyed. For what good hashe told you? and when you were in health, what good was that to you? And evenif he says, "You are in a bad way," do not despond. For what is it to be ill?is it that you are near the severance of the soul and the body? what harm isthere in this? If you are not near now, will you not afterward be near? Is theworld going to be turned upside down when you are dead? Why then do you flatterthe physician? Why do you say, "If you please, master, I shall be well"? Why doyou give him an opportunity of raising his eyebrows? Do you not value aphysician, as you do a shoemaker when he is measuring your foot, or a carpenterwhen he is building your house, and so treat the physician as to the body whichis not yours, but by nature dead? He who has a fever has an opportunity ofdoing this: if he does these things, he has what belongs to him. For it is notthe business of a philosopher to look after these externals, neither his winenor his oil nor his poor body, but his own ruling power. But as to externalshow must he act? so far as not to be careless about them. Where then is therereason for fear? where is there, then, still reason for anger, and of fearabout what belongs to others, about things which are of no value? For we oughtto have these two principles in readiness: that except the will nothing is goodnor bad; and that we ought not to lead events, but to follow them. "My brotherought not to have behaved thus to me." No; but he will see to that: and,however he may behave, I will conduct myself toward him as I ought. For this ismy own business: that belongs to another; no man can prevent this, the otherthing can be hindered.

Certain miscellaneous matters
</p>

<p>
    There are certain penalties fixed as by law for those who disobey thedivine administration. Whoever thinks any other thing to be good except thosethings which depend on the will, let him envy, let him desire, let him flatter,let him be perturbed: whoever considers anything else to be evil, let himgrieve, let him lament, let him weep, let him be unhappy. And yet, though soseverely punished, we cannot desist.    Remember what the poet says about the stranger:       Stranger, I must not, e'en if a worse man come.This, then, may be applied even to a father: "I must not, even if a worse manthan you should come, treat a father unworthily-, for all are from paternalZeus." And of a brother, "For all are from the Zeus who presides over kindred."And so in the other relations of life we shall find Zeus to be an inspector.

About exercise
</p>

<p>
    We ought not to make our exercises consist in means contrary to nature andadapted to cause admiration, for, if we do so, we, who call ourselvesphilosophers, shall not differ at all from jugglers. For it is difficult evento walk on a rope; and not only difficult, but it is also dangerous. Ought wefor this reason to practice walking on a rope, or setting up a palm tree, orembracing statues? By no means. Everything, which is difficult and dangerous isnot suitable for practice; but that is suitable which conduces to the workingout of that which is proposed to us as a thing to be worked out. To live withdesire and aversion, free from restraint. And what is this? Neither to bedisappointed in that which you desire, nor to fall into anything which youwould avoid. Toward this object, then, exercise ought to tend. For, since it isnot possible to have your desire not disappointed and your aversion free fromfalling into that which you would avoid, great and constant practice you mustknow that if you allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which are notwithin the power of the will, you will neither have your desire capable ofattaining your object, nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding thatwhich you would avoid. And since strong habit leads, and we are accustomed toemploy desire and aversion only to things which are not within the power of ourwill, we ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit, and where there isgreat slipperiness in the appearances, there to oppose the habit of exercise.    I am rather inclined to pleasure: I will incline to the contrary side abovemeasure for the sake of exercise. I am averse to pain: I will rub and exerciseagainst this the appearances which are presented to me for the purpose ofwithdrawing my aversion from every such thing. For who is a practitioner inexercise? He who practices not using his desire, and applies his aversion onlyto things which are within the power of his will, and practices most in thethings which are difficult to conquer. For this reason one man must practicehimself more against one thing and another against another thing. What, then,is it to the purpose to set up a palm tree, or to carry about a tent of skins,or a mortar and a pestle? Practice, man, if you are irritable, to endure if youare abused, not to be vexed if you are treated with dishonour. Then you willmake so much progress that, even if a man strikes you, you will say toyourself, "Imagine that you have embraced a statue": then also exerciseyourself to use wine properly so as not to drink much, for in this also thereare men who foolishly practice themselves; but first of all you should abstainfrom it, and abstain from a young girl and dainty cakes. Then at last, ifoccasion presents itself, for the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time,you will descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower you as theydid formerly. But at first fly far from that which is stronger than yourself:the contest is unequal between a charming young girl and a beginner inphilosophy. "The earthen pitcher," as the saying is, "and the rock do notagree."    After the desire and the aversion comes the second topic of the movementstoward action and the withdrawals from it; that you may be obedient to reason,that you do nothing out of season or place, or contrary to any propriety of thekind. The third topic concerns the assents, which is related to the thingswhich are persuasive and attractive. For as Socrates said, "we ought not tolive a life without examination," so we ought not to accept an appearancewithout examination, but we should say, "Wait, let me see what you are andwhence you come"; like the watch at night, "Show me the pass." "Have you thesignal from nature which the appearance that may be accepted ought to have?"And finally whatever means are applied to the body by those who exercise it, ifthey tend in any way toward desire and it, aversion, they also may be fit meansof exercise; but if they are for display, they are the indications of one whohas turned himself toward something external, and who is hunting for somethingelse, and who looks for spectators who will say, "Oh the great man." For thisreason, Apollonius said well, "When you intend to exercise yourself for yourown advantage, and you are thirsty from heat, take in a mouthful of cold water,and spit it out, and tell nobody."

What solitude is, and what kind of person a solitary man is
</p>

<p>
    Solitude is a certain condition of a helpless man. For because a man isalone, he is not for that reason also solitary; just as though a man is amongnumbers, he is not therefore not solitary. When then we have lost either abrother, or a son, or a friend on whom we were accustomed to repose, we saythat we are left solitary, though we are often in Rome, though such a crowdmeet us, though so many live in the same place, and sometimes we have a greatnumber of slaves. For the man who is solitary, as it is conceived, isconsidered to be a helpless person and exposed to those who wish to harm him.For this reason when we travel, then especially do we say that we are lonelywhen we fall among robbers, for it is not the sight of a human creature whichremoves us from solitude, but the sight of one who is faithful and modest andhelpful to us. For if being alone is enough to make solitude, you may say thateven Zeus is solitary in the conflagration and bewails himself saying, "Unhappythat I am who have neither Hera, nor Athena, nor Apollo, nor brother, nor son,nor descendant nor kinsman." This is what some say that he does when he isalone at the conflagration. For they do not understand how a man passes hislife when he is alone, because they set out from a certain natural principle,from the natural desire of community and mutual love and from the pleasure ofconversation among men. But none the less a man ought to be prepared in amanner for this also, to be able to be sufficient for himself and to be his owncompanion. For as Zeus dwells with himself, and is tranquil by himself, andthinks of his own administration and of its nature, and is employed in thoughtssuitable to himself; so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves, not tofeel the want of others also, not to be unprovided with the means of passingour time; to observe the divine administration and the relation of ourselves toeverything else; to consider how we formerly were affected toward things thathappen and how at present; what are still the things which give us pain; howthese also can be cured and how removed; if any things require improvement, toimprove them according to reason.    For you see that Caesar appears to furnish us with great peace, that thereare no longer enemies nor battles nor great associations of robbers nor ofpirates, but we can travel at every hour and sail from east to west. But canCaesar give us security from fever also, can he from shipwreck, from fire, fromearthquake or from lightning? well, I will say, can he give us security againstlove? He cannot. From sorrow? He cannot. From envy? He cannot. In a word thenhe cannot protect us from any of these things. But the doctrine of philosopherspromises to give us security even against these things. And what does it say?"Men, if you will attend to me, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, youwill not feel sorrow, nor anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance, but you willpass your time without perturbations and free from everything." When a man hasthis peace, not proclaimed by Caesar (for how should he be able to proclaimit?), but by God through reason, is he not content when he is alone? when hesees and reflects, "Now no evil can happen to me; for me there is no robber, noearthquake, everything is full of peace, full of tranquillity: every way, everycity, every meeting, neighbor, companion is harmless. One person whose businessit is, supplies me with food; another with raiment; another with perceptions,and preconceptions. And if he does not supply what is necessary, He gives thesignal for retreat, opens the door, and says to you, 'Go.' Go whither? Tonothing terrible, but to the place from which you came, to your friends andkinsmen, to the elements: what there was in you of fire goes to fire; of earth,to earth; of air, to air; of water to water: no Hades, nor Acheron, norCocytus, nor Pyriphlegethon, but all is full of Gods and Demons." When a manhas such things to think on, and sees the sun, the moon and stars, and enjoysearth and sea, he is not solitary nor even helpless. "Well then, if some manshould come upon me when I am alone and murder me?" Fool, not murder you, butyour poor body.    What kind of solitude then remains? what want? why do we make ourselvesworse than children? and what do children do when they are left alone? Theytake up shells and ashes, and they build something, then pull it down, andbuild something else, and so they never want the means of passing the time.Shall I, then, if you sail away, sit down and weep, because I have been leftalone and solitary? Shall I then have no shells, no ashes? But children do whatthey do through want of thought, and we through knowledge are unhappy.    Every great power is dangerous to beginners. You must then bear such thingsas you are able, but conformably to nature: but not... Practice sometimes a wayof living like a man in health. Abstain from food, drink water, abstainsometimes altogether from desire, in order that you may some time desireconsistently with reason; and if consistently with reason, when you haveanything good in you, you will desire well. "Not so; but we wish to live likewise men immediately and to be useful to men." Useful how? what are you doing?have you been useful to yourself? "But, I suppose, you wish to exhort them."You exhort them! You wish to be useful to them. Show to them in your ownexample what kind of men philosophy makes, and don't trifle. When you areeating, do good to those who eat with you; when you are drinking, to those whoare drinking with you; by yielding to all, giving way, bearing with them, thusdo them good, and do not spit on them your phlegm.

Certain miscellaneous matters
</p>

<p>
    As bad tragic actors cannot sing alone, but in company with many: so somepersons cannot walk about alone. Man, if you are anything, both walk alone andtalk to yourself, and do not hide yourself in the chorus. Examine a little atlast, look around, stir yourself up, that you may know who you are.    When a man drinks water, or does anything for the sake of practice,whenever there is an opportunity he tells it to all: "I drink water." Is it forthis that you drink water, for the purpose of drinking water? Man, if it isgood for you to drink, drink; but if not, you are acting ridiculously. But ifit is good for you and you do drink, say nothing about it to those who aredispleased with water-drinkers. What then, do you wish to please these verymen?
    Of things that are done some are done with a final purpose, some accordingto occasion, others with a certain reference to circumstances, others for thepurpose of complying with others. and some according to a fixed scheme of life.    You must root out of men these two things, arrogance and distrust.Arrogance, then, is the opinion that you want nothing: but distrust is theopinion that you cannot be happy when so many circumstances surround you.Arrogance is removed by confutation; and Socrates was the first who practicedthis. And, that the thing is not impossible, inquire and seek. This search willdo you no harm; and in a manner this is philosophizing, to seek how it ispossible to employ desire and aversion without impediment.    "I am superior to you, for my father is a man of consular rank." Anothersays, "I have been a tribune, but you have not." If we were horses, would yousay, "My father was swifter?" "I have much barley and fodder, or elegant neckornaments." If, then, while you were saying this, I said, "Be it so: let us runthen." Well, is there nothing in a man such as running in a horse, by which itwill he known which is superior and inferior? Is there not modesty, fidelity,justice? Show yourself superior in these, that you may be superior as a man. Ifyou tell me that you can kick violently, I also will say to you that you areproud of that which is the act of an ass.

<p>
That we ought to proceed with circumspection to everything
</p>

<p>
    In every act consider what precedes and what follows, and then proceed tothe act. If you do not consider, you will at first begin with spirit, since youhave not thought at all of the things which follow; but afterward, when someconsequences have shown themselves, you will basely desist. "I wish to conquerat the Olympic games." "And I too, by the gods: for it is a fine thing." Butconsider here what precedes and what follows; and then, if it is for your good,undertake the thing. You must act according to rules, follow strict diet,abstain from delicacies, exercise yourself by compulsion at fixed times, inheat, in cold; drink no cold water, nor wine, when there is opportunity ofdrinking it. In a word you must surrender yourself to the trainer as you do toa physician. Next in the contest, you must be covered with sand, sometimesdislocate a hand, sprain an ankle, swallow a quantity of dust, be scourged withthe whip; and after undergoing all this, you must sometimes be conquered. Afterreckoning all these things, if you have still an inclination, go to theathletic practice. If you do not reckon them, observe you behave like childrenwho at one time you wi play as wrestlers, then as gladiators, then blow atrumpet, then act a tragedy, when they have seen and admired such things. Soyou also do: you are at one time a wrestler, then a gladiator, then aphilosopher, then a rhetorician; but with your whole soul you are nothing: likethe ape, you imitate all that you see; and always one thing after anotherpleases you, but that which becomes familiar displeases you. For you have neverundertaken anything after consideration, nor after having explored the wholematter and put it to a strict examination; but you have undertaken it at hazardand with a cold desire. Thus some persons having seen a philosopher and havingheard one speak like Euphrates- yet who can speak like him?- wish to bephilosophers themselves.    Man, consider first what the matter is, then your own nature also, what itis able to bear. If you are a wrestler, look at your shoulders, your thighs,your loins: for different men are naturally formed for different things. Do youthink that, if you do, you can be a philosopher? Do you think that you can eatas you do now, drink as you do now, and in the same way be angry and out ofhumour? You must watch, labour, conquer certain desires, you must depart fromyour kinsmen, be despised by your slave, laughed at by those who meet you, ineverything you must be in an inferior condition, as to magisterial office, inhonours, in courts of justice. When you have considered all these thingscompletely, then, if you think proper, approach to philosophy, if you wouldgain in exchange for these things freedom from perturbations, liberty,tranquillity. If you have not considered these things, do not approachphilosophy: do not act like children, at one time a philosopher, then a taxcollector, then a rhetorician, then a procurator of Caesar These things are notconsistent. You must be one man either good or bad: you must either labour atyour own ruling faculty or at external things: you must either labour at thingswithin or at external things: that is, you must either occupy the place of aphilosopher or that of one of the vulgar.    A person said to Rufus when Galba was murdered, "Is the world now governedby Providence?" But Rufus replied, "Did I ever incidentally form an argumentfrom Galba that the world is governed by Providence?"

<p>
That we ought with caution to enter, into familiar intercourse with men
</p>

<p>
    If a man has frequent intercourse with others, either for talk, or drinkingtogether, or generally for social purposes, he must either become like them, orchange them to his own fashion. For if a man places a piece of quenchedcharcoal close to a piece that is burning, either the quenched charcoal willquench the other, or the burning charcoal will light that which is quenched.Since, then, the danger is so great, we must cautiously enter into suchintimacies with those of the common sort, and remember that it is impossiblethat a man can keep company with one who is covered with soot without beingpartaker of the soot himself. For what will you do if a man speaks aboutgladiators, about horses, about athletes, or, what is worse, about men? "Such aperson is bad," "Such a person is good": "This was well done," "This was donebadly." Further, if he scoff, or ridicule, or show an ill-natured disposition?Is any man among us prepared like a lute-player when he takes a lute, so thatas soon as he has touched the strings, he discovers which are discordant, andtunes the instrument? such a power as Socrates had who in all his socialintercourse could lead his companions to his own purpose? How should you havethis power? It is therefore a necessary consequence that you are carried aboutby the common kind of people.    Why, then, are they more powerful than you? Because they utter theseuseless words from their real opinions: but you utter your elegant words onlyfrom your lips; for this reason they are without strength and dead, and it isnauseous to listen to your exhortations and your miserable virtue, which istalked of everywhere. In this way the vulgar have the advantage over you: forevery opinion is strong and invincible. Until, then, the good sentiments arefixed in you, and you shall have acquired a certain power for your security, Iadvise you to be careful in your association with like wax in the sun therewill be melted away whatever you inscribe on your minds in the school.Withdraw, then, yourselves far from the sun so long as you have these waxensentiments. For this reason also philosophers advise men to leave their nativecountry, because ancient habits distract them and do not allow a beginning tobe made of a different habit; nor can we tolerate those who meet us and say:"See such a one is now a philosopher, who was once so-and-so." Thus alsophysicians send those who have lingering diseases to a different country and adifferent air; and they do right, Do you also introduce other habits than thosewhich you have: fix your opinions and exercise yourselves in them. But you donot so: you go hence to a spectacle, to a show of gladiators, to a place ofexercise, to a circus; then you come back hither, and again from this place yougo to those places, and still the same persons. And there is no pleasing habit,nor attention, nor care about self and observation of this kind, "How shall Iuse the appearances presented to me? according to nature, or contrary tonature? how do I answer to them? as I ought, or as I ought not? Do I say tothose things which are independent of the will, that they do not concern me?"For if you are not yet in this state, fly from your former habits, fly from thecommon sort, if you intend ever to begin to be something.

On providence
</p>

<p>
    When you make any charge against Providence, consider, and you will learnthat the thing has happened according to reason. "Yes, but the unjust man hasthe advantage." In what? "In money." Yes, for he is superior to you in this,that he flatters, is free from shame, and is watchful. What is the wonder? Butsee if he has the advantage over you in being faithful, in being modest: foryou will not find it to be so; but wherein you are superior, there you willfind that you have the advantage. And I once said to a man who was vexedbecause Philostorgus was fortunate: "Would you choose to lie with Sura?" "Mayit never happen," he replied, "that this day should come?" "Why then are youvexed, if he receives something in return for that which he sells; or how canyou consider him happy who acquires those things by such means as youabominate; or what wrong does Providence, if he gives the better things to thebetter men? Is it not better to be modest than to be rich?" He admitted this.Why are you vexed then, man, when you possess the better thing? Remember, then,always, and have in readiness, the truth that this is a law of nature, that thesuperior has an advantage over the inferior in that in which he is superior;and you will never be vexed.    "But my wife treats me badly." Well, if any man asks you what this is, say,"My wife treats me badly." "Is there, then, nothing more?" Nothing. "My fathergives me nothing." But to say that this is an evil is something which must beadded to it externally, and falsely added. For this reason we must not get ridof poverty, but of the opinion about poverty, and then we shall be happy.

<p>
That we ought not to be disturbed by any news
</p>

<p>
    When anything shall be reported to you which is of a nature to disturb,have this principle in readiness, that the news is about nothing which iswithin the power of your will. Can any man report to you that you have formed abad opinion, or had a bad desire? By no means. But perhaps he will report thatsome person is dead. What then is that to you? He may report that some personspeaks ill of you. What then is that to you? Or that your father is planningsomething or other. Against whom? Against your will? How can he? But is itagainst your poor body, against your little property? You are quite safe: it isnot against you. But the judge declares that you have committed an act ofimpiety. And did not the judges make the same declaration against Socrates ?Does it concern you that the judge has made this declaration? No. Why then doyou trouble yourself any longer about it? Your father has a certain duty, andif he shall not fulfill it, he loses the character of a father, of a man ofnatural affection, of gentleness. Do not wish him to lose anything else on thisaccount. For never does a man do wrong, in one thing, and suffer in another. Onthe other side it is your duty to make your defense firmly, modestly, withoutanger: but if you do not, you also lose the character of a son, of a man ofmodest behavior, of generous character. Well then, is the judge free fromdanger? No; but he also is in equal danger. Why then are you still afraid ofhis decision? What have you to do with that which is another man's evil? It isyour own evil to make a bad defense: be on your guard against this only. But tobe condemned or not to be condemned, as that is the act of another person, soit is the evil of another person. "A certain person threatens you." Me? No. "Heblames you." Let him see how he manages his own affairs. "He is going tocondemn you unjustly." He is a wretched man.

<p>
What is the condition of a common kind of man and of a philosopher
</p>

<p>
    The first difference between a common person and a philosopher is this: thecommon person says, "Woe to me for my little child, for my brother, for myfather." The philosopher, if he shall ever be compelled to say, "Woe to me,"stops and says, "but for myself." For nothing which is independent of the willcan hinder or damage the will, and the will can only hinder or damage itself.If, then, we ourselves incline in this direction, so as, when we are unlucky,to blame ourselves and to remember that nothing else is the cause ofperturbation or loss of tranquillity except our own opinion, I swear to you byall the gods that we have made progress. But in the present state of affairs wehave gone another way from the beginning. For example, while we were stillchildren, the nurse, if we ever stumbled through want of care, did not chideus, but would beat the stone. But what did the stone do? Ought the stone tohave moved on account of your child's folly? Again, if we find nothing to eaton coming out of the bath, the pedagogue never checks our appetite, but heflogs the cook. Man, did we make you the pedagogue of the cook and not of thechild? Correct the child, improve him. In this way even when we are grown up weare like children. For he who is unmusical is a child in music; he who iswithout letters is a child in learning: he who is untaught, is a child in life.

</p>

<p>
That we can derive advantage from all external things
</p>

<p>
    In the case of appearances, which are objects of the vision, nearly allhave allowed the good and the evil to be in ourselves, and not in externals. Noone gives the name of good to the fact that it is day, nor bad to the fact thatit is night, nor the name of the greatest evil to the opinion that three arefour. But what do men say? They say that knowledge is good, and that error isbad; so that even in respect to falsehood itself there is a good result, theknowledge that it is falsehood. So it ought to be in life also. "Is health agood thing, and is sickness a bad thing" No, man. "But what is it?" To behealthy, and healthy in a right way, is good: to be healthy in a bad way isbad; so that it is possible to gain advantage even from sickness, I declare.For is it not possible to gain advantage even from death, and is it notpossible to gain advantage from mutilation? Do you think that Menoeceus gainedlittle by death? "Could a man who says so, gain so much as Menoeceus gained?"Come, man, did he not maintain the character of being a lover of his country, aman of great mind, faithful, generous? And if he had continued to live, wouldhe not have lost all these things? would he not have gained the opposite? wouldhe not have gained the name of coward, ignoble, a hater of his country, a manwho feared death? Well, do you think that he gained little by dying? "I supposenot." But did the father of Admetus gain much by prolonging his life so ignoblyand miserably? Did he not die afterward? Cease, I adjure you by the gods, toadmire things. Cease to make yourselves slaves, first of things, then onaccount of things slaves of those who are able to give them or take them away.    "Can advantage then be derived from these things." From all; and from himwho abuses you. Wherein does the man who exercises before the combat profit theathlete? Very greatly. This man becomes my exerciser before the combat: heexercises me in endurance, in keeping my temper, in mildness. You say no: buthe, who lays hold of my neck and disciplines my loins and shoulders, does megood; and the exercise master does right when he says: "Raise him up with bothhands, and the heavier he is, so much the more is my advantage." But if a manexercises me in keeping my, temper, does he not do good? This is not knowinghow to gain an advantage from men. "Is my neighbour bad?" Bad to himself, butgood to me: he exercises my good disposition, my moderation. "Is my father bad?" Bad to himself, but to me good. This is the rod of Hermes: "Touch with itwhat you please," as the saying is. "and it will be of gold." I say not so: butbring what you please, and I will make it good. Bring disease, bring death,bring poverty, bring abuse, bring trial on capital charges: all these thingsthrough the rod of Hermes shall be made profitable. "What will you do withdeath?" Why, what else than that it shall do you honour, or that it shall showyou by act through it, what a man is who follows the will of nature? "What willyou do with disease?" I will show its nature, I will be conspicuous in, it, Iwill be firm, I will be happy, I will not flatter the physician, I will notwish to die. What else do you seek? Whatever you shall give me, I will make ithappy, fortunate, honoured, a thing which a man shall seek.    You say No: but take care that you do not fall sick: it is a bad thing."This is the same as if you should say, "Take care that you never receive theimpression that three are four: that is bad." Man, how is it bad? If I thinkabout it as I ought, how shall it, then, do me any damage? and shall it noteven do me good? If, then, I think about poverty as I ought to do, aboutdisease, about not having office, is not that enough for me? will it not be anadvantage? How, then, ought I any longer to look to seek evil and good inexternals? What happens these doctrines are maintained here, but no man carriesthem away home; but immediately every one is at war with his slave, with hisneighbours, with those who have sneered at him, with those who have ridiculedhim. Good luck to Lesbius, who daily proves that I know nothing.

Against those who readily come to the profession of sophists
</p>

<p>
    They who have taken up bare theorems immediately wish to vomit them forth,as persons whose stomach is diseased do with food. First digest the thing, thendo not vomit it up thus: f you do not digest it, the thing become truly anemetic, a crude food and unfit to eat. But after digestion show us some chancein your ruling faculty, as athletes show in their shoulders by what they havebeen exercised and what they have eaten; as those who have taken up certainarts show by what they have learned. The carpenter does not come and say, "Hearme talk about the carpenter's art"; but having undertaken to build a house, hemakes it, and proves that he knows the art. You also ought to do something ofthe kind; eat like a man, drink like a man, dress, marry, beget children, dothe office of a citizen, endure abuse, bear unreasonable brother, bear withyour father, bear with your son, neighbour, compassion. Show us these thingsthat we may see that you have in truth learned something from the philosophers.You say, "No, but come and hear me read commentaries." Go away, and seeksomebody to vomit them on. "And indeed I will expound to you the writings ofChrysippus as no other man can: I will explain his text most clearly: I willadd also, if I can, the vehemence of Antipater and Archedemus."    Is it, then, for this that young men shall leave their country and theirparents, that they may come to this place, and hear you explain words? Oughtthey not to return with a capacity to endure, to be active in association withothers, free from passions, free from perturbation, with such a provision forthe journey of life with which they shall be able to bear well the things thathappen and derive honour from them? And how can you give them any of thesethings which you do not possess? Have you done from the beginning anything elsethan employ yourself about the resolution of Syllogisms, of sophisticalarguments, and in those which work by questions? "But such a man has a school;why should not I also have a school?" These things are not done, man, in acareless way, nor just as it may happen; but there must be a (fit) age and lifeand God as a guide. You say, "No." But no man sails from a port without havingsacrificed to the Gods and invoked their help; nor do men sow without havingcalled on Demeter; and shall a man who has undertaken so great a work undertakeit safely without the Gods? and shall they who undertake this work come to itwith success? What else are you doing, man, than divulging the mysteries? Yousay, "There is a temple at Eleusis, and one here also. There is an Hierophantat Eleusis, and I also will make an Hierophant: there is a herald, and I willestablish a herald; there is a torch-bearer at Eleusis, and I also willestablish a torch-bearer; there are torches at Eleusis, and I will have torcheshere. The words are the same: how do the things done here differ from thosedone there?" Most impious man, is there no difference? these things are doneboth in due place and in due time; and when accompanied with sacrifice andprayers, when a man is first purified, and when he is disposed in his mind tothe thought that he is going to approach sacred rites and ancient rites. Inthis way the mysteries are useful, in this way we come to the notion that allthese things were established by the ancients for the instruction andcorrection of life. But you publish and divulge them out of time, out of place,without sacrifices, without purity; you have not the garments which thehierophant ought to have, nor the hair, nor the head-dress, nor the voice, northe age; nor have you purified yourself as he has: but you have committed tomemory the words only, and you say: "Sacred are the words by themselves."    You ought to approach these matters in another way; the thing is great, itis mystical, not a common thing, nor is it given to every man. But not evenwisdom perhaps is enough to enable a man to take care of youths: a man musthave also a certain readiness and fitness for this purpose, and a certainquality of body, and above all things he must have God to advise him to occupythis office, as God advised Socrates to occupy the place of one who confuteserror, Diogenes the office of royalty and reproof, and the office of teachingprecepts. But you open a doctor's shop, though you have nothing except physic:but where and how they should be applied, you know not nor have you taken anytrouble about it. "See," that man says, "I too have salves for the eyes." Haveyou also the power of using them? Do you know both when and how they will dogood, and to whom they will do good? Why then do you act at hazard in things ofthe greatest importance? why are you careless? why do you undertake a thingthat is in no way fit for you? Leave it to those who are able to do it, and todo it well. Do not yourself bring disgrace on philosophy through your own acts,and be not one of those who load it with a bad reputation. But if theoremsplease you, sit still and turn them over by yourself; but never say that youare a philosopher, nor allow another to say it; but say: "He is mistaken, forneither are my desires different from what they were before, nor is my activitydirected to other objects, nor do I assent to other things, nor in the use ofappearances have I altered at all from my former condition." This you mustthink and say about yourself, if you would think as you ought: if not, act athazard, and do what you are doing; for it becomes you.

About cynicism
</p>

<p>
    When one of his pupils inquired of Epictetus, and he was a person whoappeared to be inclined to Cynism, what kind of person a Cynic ought to be andwhat was the notion of the thing, We will inquire, said Epictetus, at leisure:but I have so much to say to you that he who without God attempts so great amatter, is hateful to God, and has no other purpose than to act indecently inpublic. For in any well-managed house no man comes forward, and says tohimself, "I ought to be manager of the house." If he does so, the master turnsround and, seeing him insolently giving orders, drags him forth and flogs him.So it is also in this great city; for here also there is a master of the housewho orders everything. "You are the sun; you can by going round make the yearand seasons, and make the fruits grow and nourish them, and stir the winds andmake them remit, and warm the bodies of men properly: go, travel round, and soadminister things from the greatest to the least." "You are a calf; when a lionshall appear, do your proper business: if you do not, you will suffer." "Youare a bull: advance and fight, for this is your business, and becomes you, andyou can do it." "You can lead the army against Illium; be Agamemnon." "You canfight in single combat against Hector: be Achilles." But if Thersites cameforward and claimed the command, he would either not have obtained it; or, ifhe did obtain it, he would have disgraced himself before many witnesses.    Do you also think about the matter carefully: it is not what it seems toyou. "I wear a cloak now and I shall wear it then: I sleep hard now, and Ishall sleep hard then: I will take in addition a little bag now and a staff,and I will go about and begin to beg and to abuse those whom I meet; and if Isee any man plucking the hair out of his body, I will rebuke him, or if he hasdressed his hair, or if he walks about in purple." If you imagine the thing tobe such as this, keep far away from it: do not approach it: it is not at allfor you. But if you imagine it to be what it is, and do not think yourself tobe unfit for it, consider what a great thing you undertake.    In the first place in the things which relate to yourself, you must not bein any respect like what you do now: you must not blame God or man: you musttake away desire altogether, you must transfer avoidance only to the thingswhich are within the power of the will: you must not feel anger nor resentmentnor envy nor pity; a girl must not appear handsome to you, nor must you love alittle reputation, nor be pleased with a boy or a cake. For you ought to knowthat the rest of men throw walls around them and houses and darkness when theydo any such things, and they have many means of concealment. A man shuts thedoor, he sets somebody before the chamber: if a person comes, say that he isout, he is not at leisure. But the Cynic instead of all these things must usemodesty as his protection: if he does not, he will he indecent in his nakednessand under the open sky. This is his house, his door: this is the slave beforehis bedchamber: this is his darkness. For he ought not to wish to hide anythingthat he does: and if he does, he is gone, he has lost the character of a Cynic,of a man who lives under the open sky, of a free man: he has begun to fear someexternal thing, he has begun to have need of concealment, nor can he getconcealment when he chooses. For where shall he hide himself and how? And if bychance this public instructor shall be detected, this pedagogue, what kind ofthings will he be compelled to suffer? when then a man fears these things, isit possible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend men? Itcannot be: it is impossible.    In the first place, then, you must make your ruling faculty pure, and thismode of life also. "Now, to me the matter to work on is my understanding, aswood is to the carpenter, as hides to the shoemaker; and my business is theright use of appearances. But the body is nothing to me: the parts of it arenothing to me. Death? Let it come when it chooses, either death of the whole orof a part. Fly, you say. And whither; can any man eject me out of the world? Hecannot. But wherever I ever I go, there is the sun, there is the moon, thereare the stars, dreams, omens, and the conversation with Gods."    Then, if he is thus prepared, the true Cynic cannot be satisfied with this;but he must know that he is sent a messenger from Zeus to men about good andbad things, to show them that they have wandered and are seeking the substanceof good and evil where it is not, but where it is, they never think; and thathe is a spy, as Diogenes was carried off to Philip after the battle ofChaeroneia as a spy. For, in fact, a Cynic is a spy of the things which aregood for men and which are evil, and it is his duty to examine carefully and tocome and report truly, and not to be struck with terror so as to point out asenemies those who are not enemies, nor in any other way to be perturbed byappearances nor confounded.    It is his duty, then, to he able with a loud voice, if the occasion shouldarise, and appearing on the tragic stage to say like Socrates: "Men, whitherare you hurrying, what are you doing, wretches? like blind people you arewandering up and down: you are going by another road, and have left the trueroad: you seek for prosperity and happiness where they are not, and if anothershows you where they are, you do not believe him." Why do you seek it without?In the body? It is not there. If you doubt, look at Myro, look at Ophellius. Inpossessions? It is not there. But if you do not believe me, look at Croesus:look at those who are now rich, with what lamentations their life is filled. Inpower? It is not there. If it is, those must be happy who have been twice andthrice consuls; but they are not. Whom shall we believe in these matters? youwho from without see their affairs and are dazzled by an appearance, or the menthemselves? What do they say? Hear them when they groan, when they grieve, whenon account of these very consulships and glory and splendour they think thatthey are more wretched and in greater danger. Is it in royal power? It is not:if it were, Nero would have been happy, and Sardanapalus. But neither wasAgamemnon happy, though he was a better man than Sardanapalus and Nero; butwhile others are snoring what is he doing?       "Much from his head he tore his rooted hair."And what does he say himself?       "I am perplexed," he says, "and       Disturb'd I am," and "my heart out of my bosom       Is leaping."    Wretch, which of your affairs goes badly? Your possessions? No. Your body?No. But you are rich in gold and copper. What then is the matter with you? Thatpart of you, whatever it is, has been neglected by you and is corrupted, thepart with which we desire, with which we avoid, with which we move toward andmove from things. How neglected? He knows not the nature of good for which heis made by nature and the nature of evil; and what is his own, and what belongsto another; and when anything that belongs to others goes badly, he says, "Woeto me, for the Hellenes are in dancer." Wretched is his ruling faculty, andalone neglected and uncared for. "The Hellenes are going to die destroyed bythe Trojans." And if the Trojans do not kill them, will they not die? "Yes; butnot all at once." What difference, then, does it make? For if death is an evil,whether men die altogether, or if they die singly, it is equally an evil. Isanything else then going to happen than the separation of the soul and thebody? Nothing. And if the Hellenes perish, is the door closed, and is it not inyour power to die? "It is." Why then do you lament "Oh, you who are a king andhave the sceptre of Zeus?" An unhappy king does not exist more than an unhappygod. What then art thou? In truth a shepherd: for you weep as shepherds do,when a wolf has carried off one of their sheep: and these who are governed byyou are sheep. And why did you come hither? Was your desire in any danger? wasyour aversion? was your movement? was your avoidance of things? He replies,"No; but the wife of my brother was carried off." Was it not then a great gainto be deprived of an adulterous wife? "Shall we be despised, then, by theTrojans?" What kind of people are the Trojans, wise or foolish? If they arewise, why do you fight with them? If they are fools, why do you care aboutthem.    In what, then, is the good, since it is not in these things? Tell us, youwho are lord, messenger and spy. Where you do not think that it is, nor chooseto seek it: for if you chose to seek it, you would have found it to he inyourselves; nor would you be wandering out of the way, nor seeking what belongsto others as if it were your own. Turn your thoughts into yourselves: observethe preconceptions which you have. What kind of a thing do you imagine the goodto be? "That which flows easily, that which is happy, that which is notimpeded." Come, and do you not naturally imagine it to be great, do you notimagine it to be valuable? do you not imagine it to be free from harm? In whatmaterial then ought you to seek for that which flows easily, for that which isnot impeded? in that which serves or in that which is free? "In that which isfree." Do you possess the body, then, free or is it in servile condition? "Wedo not know." Do you not know that it is the slave of fever, of gout,ophthalmia, dysentery, of a tyrant, of fire, of iron, of everything which isstronger? Yes, it is a slave." How, then, is it possible that anything whichbelongs to the body can be free from hindrance? and how is a thing great orvaluable which is naturally dead, or earth, or mud? Well then, do you possessnothing which is free? "Perhaps nothing." And who is able to compel you toassent to that which appears false? "No man." And who can compel you not toassent to that which appears true? "No man." By this, then, you see that thereis something in you naturally free. But to desire or to be averse from, or tomove toward an object or to move from it, or to prepare yourself, or to proposeto do anything, which of you can do this, unless he has received an impressionof the appearance of that which is profitable or a duty? "No man." You have,then, in these thongs also something which is not hindered and is free.Wretched men, work out this, take care of this, seek for good here.    "And how is it possible that a man who has nothing, who is naked,houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city, can passa life that flows easily?" See, God has sent you a man to show you that it ispossible. "Look at me, who am without a city, without a house, withoutpossessions, without a slave; I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, nochildren; no praetorium, but only the earth and heavens, and one poor cloak.And what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? am I not without fear? Am I notfree? When did any of you see me failing in the object of my desire? or everfalling into that which I would avoid? did I ever blame God or man? did I everaccuse any man? did any of you ever see me with sorrowful countenance? And howdo I meet with those whom you are afraid of and admire? Do not I treat themlike slaves? Who, when he sees me, does not think that he sees his king andmaster?"    This is the language of the Cynics, this their character, this is theirpurpose. You say "No": but their characteristic is the little wallet, andstaff, and great jaws: the devouring of all that you give them, or storing itup, or the abusing unseasonably all whom they meet, or displaying theirshoulder as a fine thing. Do you see how you are going, to undertake so great abusiness? First take a mirror: look at your shoulders; observe your loins, yourthighs. You are going, my man, to be enrolled as a combatant in the Olympicgames, no frigid and miserable contest. In the Olympic games a man is notpermitted to be conquered only and to take his departure; but first he must bedisgraced in the sight of all the world, not in the sight of Athenians only, orof Lacedaemonians or of Nicopolitans; next he must be whipped also if he hasentered into the contests rashly: and before being whipped, he must sufferthirst and heat, and swallow much dust.    Reflect more carefully, know thyself, consult the divinity, without Godattempt nothing; for if he shall advise you, be assured that he intends you tobecome great or to receive many blows. For this very amusing quality isconjoined to a Cynic: he must be flogged like an ass, and when he is flogged,he must love those who flog him, as if he were the father of all, and thebrother of all. You say "No"; but if a man flogs you, stand in the public placeand call out, "Caesar, what do I suffer in this state of peace under thyprotection? Let us bring the offender before the proconsul." But what is Caesarto a Cynic, or what is a proconsul, or what is any other except him who sentthe Cynic down hither, and whom he serves, namely Zeus? Does he call upon anyother than Zeus? Is he not convinced that, whatever he suffers, it is Zeus whois exercising him? Hercules when he was exercised by Eurystheus did not thinkthat he was wretched, but without hesitation he attempted to execute all thathe had in hand. And is he who is trained to the contest and exercised by Zeusgoing to call out and to be vexed, he who is worthy to bear the sceptre ofDiogenes? Hear what Diogenes says to the passers-by when he is in a fever,"Miserable wretches, will you not stay? but are you going so long a journey toOlympia to see the destruction or the fight of athletes; and will you notchoose to see the combat between a fever and a man?" Would such a man accuseGod who sent him down as if God were treating him unworthily, a man who gloriedin his circumstances, and claimed to be an example to those who were passingby? For what shall he accuse him of? because he maintains a decency ofbehavior, because he displays his virtue more conspicuously? Well, and whatdoes he say of poverty, about death, about pain? How did he compare his ownhappiness with that of the Great King? or rather he thought that there was nocomparison between them. For where there are perturbations, and griefs, andfears, and desires not satisfied, and aversions of things which you cannotavoid, and envies and jealousies, how is there a road to happiness there? Butwhere there are corrupt principles, there these things must of necessity be.    When the young man asked, if when a Cynic is sick, and a friend asks him tocome to his house and be taken care of in his sickness, shall the Cynic acceptthe invitation, he replied: And where shall you find, I ask, a Cynic's friend?For the man who invites ought to be such another as the that he may be worthyof being reckoned the Cynic's friend. He ought to be a partner in the Cynic'ssceptre and his royalty, and a worthy minister, if he intends to be consideredworthy of a Cynic's friendship, as Diogenes was a friend of Antisthenes, asCrates was a friend of Diogenes. Do you think that, if a man comes to a Cynicand salutes him, he is the Cynic's friend, and that the Cynic will think himworthy of receiving a Cynic into his house? So that, if you please, reflect onthis also: rather look round for some convenient dunghill on which you shallbear your fever and which will shelter you from the north wind that you may notbe chilled. But you seem to me to wish to go into some man's house and to bewell fed there for a time. Why then do you think of attempting so great athing?    "But," said the young man, "shall marriage and the procreation of childrenas a chief duty be undertaken by the Cynic?" If you grant me a community ofwise men, Epictetus replies, perhaps no man will readily apply himself to theCynic practice. For on whose account should he undertake this manner of life?However if we suppose that he does, nothing will prevent him from marrying andbegetting children; for his wife will be another like himself, and hisfather-in-law another like himself, and his children will be brought up likehimself. But in the present state of things which is like that of an armyplaced in battle order, is it not fit that the Cynic should without anydistraction be employed only on the administration of God, able to go aboutamong men, not tied down to the common duties of mankind, nor entangled in theordinary relations of life, which if he neglects, he will not maintain thecharacter of an honourable and good man? and if he observes them he will losethe character of the messenger, and spy and herald of God. For consider that itis his duty to do something toward his father-in-law, something to the otherkinsfolk of his wife, something to his wife also. He is also excluded by beinga Cynic from looking after the sickness of his own family, and from providingfor their support. And, to say nothing of the rest, he must have a vessel forheating water for the child that he may wash it in the bath; wool for his wifewhen she is delivered of a child, oil, a bed, a cup: so the furniture of thehouse is increased. I say nothing of his other occupations and of hisdistraction. Where, then, now is that king, he who devotes himself to thepublic interests,       The people's guardian and so full of cares.whose duty it is to look after others, the married and those who have children;to see who uses his wife well, who uses her badly; who quarrels; what family iswell administered, what is not; going about as a physician does and feelspulses? He says to one, "You have a fever," to another, "You have a headache,or the gout": he says to one, "Abstain from food"; to another he says, "Eat";or "Do not use the bath"; to another, "You require the knife, or the cautery."How can he have time for this who is tied to the duties of common life? is itnot his duty to supply clothing to his children, and to send them to theschoolmaster with writing tablets, and styles. Besides, must he not supply themwith beds? for they cannot be genuine Cynics as soon as they are born. If hedoes not do this, it would be better to expose the children as soon as they areborn than to kill them in this way. Consider what we are bringing the Cynicdown to, how we are taking his royalty from him. "Yes, but Crates took a wife."You are speaking of a circumstance which arose from love and of a woman who wasanother Crates. But we are inquiring about ordinary marriages and those whichare free from distractions, and making this inquiry we do not find the affairof marriage in this state of the world a thing which is especially suited tothe Cynic.    "How, then, shall a man maintain the existence of society?" In the name ofGod, are those men greater benefactors to society who introduce into the worldto occupy their own places two or three grunting children, or those whosuperintend as far as they can all mankind, and see what they do, how theylive, what they attend to, what they neglect contrary to their duty? Did theywho left little children to the Thebans do them more good than Epaminondas whodied childless? And did Priamus, who begat fifty worthless sons, or Danaus orAEolus contribute more to the community than Homer? then shall the duty of ageneral or the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or thebegetting of children, and such a man shall not be judged to have accepted thecondition of childlessness for nothing; and shall not the royalty of a Cynic beconsidered an equivalent for the want of children? Do we not perceive hisgrandeur and do we not justly contemplate the character of Diogenes; and do we,instead of this, turn our eyes to the present Cynics, who are dogs that wait attables and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breakingwind, but in nothing else? For such matters would not have moved us at all norshould we have wondered if a Cynic should not marry or beget children. Man, theCynic is the father of all men; the men are his sons, the women are hisdaughters: he so carefully visits all, so well does he care for all. Do youthink that it is from idle impertinence that he rebukes those whom he meets? Hedoes it as a father, as a brother, and as the minister of the father of all,the minister of Zeus.    If you please, ask me also if a Cynic shall engage in the administration ofthe state. Fool, do you seek a greater form of administration than that inwhich he is engaged? Do you ask if he shall appear among the Athenians and saysomething about the revenues and the supplies, he who must talk with all men,alike with Athenians, alike with Corinthians, alike with Romans, not aboutsupplies, nor yet about revenues, nor about peace or war, but about happinessand unhappiness, about good fortune and bad fortune, about slavery and freedom?When a man has undertaken the administration of such a state, do you ask me ifhe shall engage in the administration of a state? ask me also if he shallgovern: again I will say to you: Fool, what greater government shall heexercise than that which he exercises now?    It is necessary also for such a man to have a certain habit of body: for ifhe appears to be consumptive, thin and pale, his testimony has not then thesame weight. For he must not only by showing the qualities of the soul prove tothe vulgar that it is in his power independent of the things which they admireto be a good man, but he must also show by his body that his simple and frugalway of living in the open air does not injure even the body. "See," he says, "Iam a proof of this, and my own body also is." So Diogenes used to do, for heused to go about fresh-looking, and he attracted the notice of the many by hispersonal appearance. But if a Cynic is an object of compassion, he seems to abeggar: all persons turn away from him, all are offended with him; for neitherought he to appear dirty so that he shall not also in this respect drive awaymen; but his very roughness ought to be clean and attractive.    There ought also to belong to the Cynic much natural grace and sharpness;and if this is not so, he is a stupid fellow, and nothing else; and he musthave these qualities that he may be able readily and fitly to be a match forall circumstances that may happen. So Diogenes replied to one who said, "Areyou the Diogenes who does not believe that there are gods?" "And, how," repliedDiogenes, "can this be when I think that you are odious to the gods?" Onanother occasion in reply to Alexander, who stood by him when he was sleeping,and quoted Homer's line,       A man a councilor should not sleep all night,he answered, when he was half-asleep,       The people's guardian and so full of cares.    But before all the Cynic's ruling faculty must be purer than the sun; and,if it is not, he must be a cunning knave and a fellow of no principle, sincewhile he himself is entangled in some vice he will reprove others. For see howthe matter stands: to these kings and tyrants their guards and arms give thepower of reproving some persons, and of being able even to punish those who dowrong though they are themselves bad; but to a Cynic instead of arms and guardsit is conscience which gives this power. When he knows that be has watched andlabored for mankind, and has slept pure, and sleep has left him still purer,and that he thought whatever he has thought as a friend of the gods, as aminister, as a participator of the power of Zeus, and that on all occasions heis ready to say       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny;and also, "If so it pleases the gods, so let it be"; why should he not haveconfidence to speak freely to his own brothers, to his children, in a word tohis kinsmen? For this reason he is neither overcurious nor a busybody when heis in this state of mind: for he is not a meddler with the affairs of otherswhen he is superintending human affairs, but he is looking after his ownaffairs. If that is not so, you may also say that the general is a busybody,when he inspects his soldiers, and examines them, and watches them, andpunishes the disorderly. But if, while you have a cake under your arm, yourebuke others, I will say to you: "Will you not rather go away into a cornerand eat that which you have stolen"; what have you to do with the affairs ofothers? For who are you? are you the bull of the herd, or the queen of thebees? Show me the tokens of your supremacy, such as they have from nature. Butif you are a drone claiming the sovereignty over the bees, do you not supposethat your fellow citizens will put you down as the bees do the drones?    The Cynic also ought to have such power of endurance as to seem insensibleto the common sort and a stone: no man reviles him, no man strikes him, no maninsults him, but he gives his body that any man who chooses may do with it whathe likes. For he bears in mind that the inferior must be overpowered by thesuperior in that in which it is inferior; and the body is inferior to the many,the weaker to the stronger. He never then descends into such a contest in whichhe can be overpowered; but he immediately withdraws from things which belong toothers, he claims not the things which are servile. where there is will and theuse of appearances, there you will see how many eyes he has so that you maysay, "Argus was blind compared with him." Is his assent ever hasty, hismovement rash, does his desire ever fall in its object, does that which hewould avoid befall him, is his purpose unaccomplished, does he ever find fault,is he ever humiliated, is he ever envious? To these he directs all hisattention and energy; but as to everything else he snores supine. All is peace;there is no robber who takes away his will, no tyrant. But what say you as tohis body? I say there is. And as to magistracies and honours? What does he carefor them? When then any person would frighten him through them, he says to him,"Begone, look for children: masks are formidable to them; but I know that theyare made of shell, and they have nothing inside."    About such a matter as this you are deliberating. Therefore, if you please,I urge you in God's name, defer the matter, and first consider your preparationfor it. For see what Hector says to Andromache, "Retire rather," he says, "intothe house and weave:       War is the work of men       Of all indeed, but specially 'tis mine.So he was conscious of his own qualification, and knew her weakness.

<p>
To those who read and discuss for the sake of ostentation
</p>

<p>
    First say to yourself, who you wish to be: then do accordingly what you aredoing; for in nearly all other things we see this to be so. Those who followathletic exercises first determine what they wish to be, then do accordinglywhat follows. If a man is a runner in the long course, there is a certain kindof diet, of walking, rubbing and exercise: if a man is a runner in the stadium,all these things are different; if he is a Pentathlete, they are still moredifferent. So you will find it also in the arts. If you are a carpenter, youwill have such and such things: if a worker in metal, such things. Foreverything that we do, if we refer it to no end, we shall do it to no purpose;and if we refer it to the wrong end, we shall miss the mark. Further, there isa general end or purpose, and a particular purpose. First of all, we must actas a man. What is comprehended in this? We must not be like a sheep, thoughgentle, nor mischievous, like a wild beast. But the particular cud hasreference to each person's mode of life and his will. The lute-player acts as alute-player, the carpenter as a carpenter, the philosopher as a philosopher,the rhetorician as a rhetorician. When then you say, "Come and hear me read toyou": take care first of all that you are not doing this without a purpose;then, if you have discovered that you are doing this with reference to apurpose, consider if it is the right purpose. Do you wish to do good or to bepraised? Immediately you hear him saying, "To me what is the value of praisefrom the many?" and he says well, for it is of no value to a musician, so faras he is a musician, nor to a geometrician. Do you then wish to be useful? inwhat? tell us that we may run to your audience-room. Now can a man do anythinguseful to others, who has not received something useful himself? No, forneither can a man do anything useful in the carpenter's art, unless he is acarpenter; nor in the shoemaker's art, unless he is a shoemaker.    Do you wish to know then if you have received any advantage? Produce youropinions, philosopher. What is the thing which desire promises? Not to fall inthe object. What does aversion promise? Not to fall into that which you wouldavoid. Well; do we fulfill their promise? Tell me the truth; but if you lie, Iwill tell you. Lately when your hearers came together rather coldly, and didnot give you applause, you went away humbled. Lately again when you had beenpraised, you went about and said to all, "What did you think of me?""Wonderful, master, I swear by all that is dear to me." "But how did I treat ofthat particular matter?" "Which?" "The passage in which I described Pan and thenymphs?" "Excellently." Then do you tell me that in desire and in aversion youare acting according to nature? Begone; try to persuade somebody else. Did younot praise a certain person contrary to your opinion? and did you not flatter acertain person who was the son of a senator? Would you wish your own childrento be such persons? "I hope not." Why then did you praise and flatter him? "Heis an ingenuous youth and listens well to discourses." How is this? "He admiresme." You have stated your proof. Then what do you think? do not these verypeople secretly despise you? When, then, a man who is conscious that he hasneither done any good nor ever thinks of it, finds a philosopher who says, "Youhave a great natural talent, and you have a candid and good disposition," whatelse do you think that he says except this, "This man has some need of me?" Ortell me what act that indicates a, great mind has he shown? Observe; he hasbeen in your company a long time; he has listened to your discourses, he hasheard you reading; has he become more modest? has he been turned to reflect onhimself? has he perceived in what a bad state he is? has he cast awayself-conceit? does he look for a person to teach him? "He does." A man who willteach him to live? No, fool, but how to talk; for it is for this that headmires you also. Listen and hear what he says: "This man writes with perfectart, much better than Dion." This is altogether another thing. Does he say,"This man is modest, faithful, free from perturbations?" and even if he did sayit, I should say to him, "Since this man is faithful, tell me what thisfaithful man is." And if he could not tell me, I should add this, "Firstunderstand what you say, then speak."    You, then, who are in a wretched plight and gaping after applause andcounting your auditors, do you intend to be useful to others? "To-day many moreattended my discourse." "Yes, many; we suppose five hundred." "That is nothing;suppose that there were a thousand." "Dion never had so many hearers." "Howcould he?" "And they understand what is said beautifully." "What is fine,master, can move even a stone." See, these are the words of a philosopher. Thisis the disposition of a man who will do good to others; here is a man who haslistened to discourses, who has read what is written about Socrates asSocratic, not as the compositions of Lysias and Isocrates. "I have oftenwondered by what arguments." Not so, but "by what argument": this is more exactthan that. What, have you read the words at all in a different way from that inwhich you read little odes? For if you read them as you ought, you would nothave been attending to such matters, but you would rather have been looking tothese words: "Anytus and Meletus are able to kill me, but they cannot harm me":and "I am always of such a disposition as to pay regard to nothing of my ownexcept to the reason which on inquiry seems to me the best." Hence who everheard Socrates say, "I know something and I teach"; but he used to senddifferent people to different teachers. Therefore they used to come to him andask to be introduced to philosophy by him; and he would take them and recommendthem. Not so; but as he accompanied them he would say, "Hear me to-daydiscoursing in the house of Quadratus." Why should I hear you? Do you wish toshow me that you put words together cleverly? You put them together, man; andwhat good will it do you? "But only praise me." What do you mean by praising?"Say to me, "Admirable, wonderful." Well, I say so. But if that is praisewhatever it is which philosophers mean by the name of good, what have I topraise in you? If it is good to speak well, teach me, and will praise you."What then? ought a man to listen to such things without pleasure?" I hope not.For my part I do not listen even to a lute-player without pleasure. Must I thenfor this reason stand and play the lute? Hear what Socrates says, "Nor would itbe seemly for a man of my age, like a young man composing addresses, to appearbefore you." "Like a young man," he says. For in truth this small art is anelegant thing, to select words, and to put them together, and to come forwardand gracefully to read them or to speak, and while he is reading to say, "Thereare not many who can do these things, I swear by all that you value."    Does a philosopher invite people to hear him? As the sun himself draws mento him, or as food does, does not the philosopher also draw to him those whowill receive benefit? What physician invites a man to be treated by him? IndeedI now hear that even the physicians in Rome do invite patients, but when Ilived there, the physicians were invited. "I invite you to come and hear thatthings are in a bad way for you, and that you are taking care of everythingexcept that of which you ought to take care, and that you are ignorant of thegood and the bad and are unfortunate and unhappy." A fine kind of invitation:and yet if the words of the philosopher do not produce this effect on you, heis dead, and so is the speaker. Rufus was used to say: "If you have leisure topraise me, I am speaking to no purpose." Accordingly he used to speak in such away that every one of us who were sitting there supposed that some one hadaccused him before Rufus: he so touched on what was doing, he so placed beforethe eyes every man's faults.    The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you ought not to go out ofit with pleasure, but with pain. For you are not in sound health when youenter: one has dislocated his shoulder, another has an abscess, a third afistula, and a fourth a headache. Then do I sit and utter to you littlethoughts and exclamations that you may praise me and go away, one with hisshoulder in the same condition in which he entered, another with his head stillaching, and a third with his fistula or his abscess just as they were? Is itfor this then that young men shall quit home, and leave their parents and theirfriends and kinsmen and property, that they may say to you, "Wonderful!" whenyou are uttering your exclamations. Did Socrates do this, or Zeno, orCleanthes?    What then? is there not the hortatory style? Who denies it? as there is thestyle of refutation, and the didactic style. Who, then, ever reckoned a fourthstyle with these, the style of display? What is the hortatory style? To be ableto show both to one person and to many the struggle in which they are engaged,and that they think more about anything than about what they really wish. Forthey wish the things which lead to happiness, but they look for them in thewrong place. In order that this may be done, a thousand seats must be placedand men must be invited to listen, and you must ascend the pulpit in a finerobe or cloak and describe the death of Achilles. Cease, I entreat you by thegods, to spoil good words and good acts as much as you can. Nothing can havemore power in exhortation than when the speaker shows to the hearers that hehas need of them. But tell me who when he hears you reading or discoursing isanxious about himself or turns to reflect on himself? or when he has gone outsays, "The philosopher hit me well: I must no longer do these things." But doeshe not, even if you have a great reputation, say to some person, "He spokefinely about Xerxes"; and another says, "No, but about the battle ofThermopylae"? Is this listening to a philosopher?

    Let not that which in another is contrary to nature be an evil to you: foryou are not formed by nature to be depressed with others nor to be unhappy withothers, but to be happy with them. If a man is unhappy, remember that hisunhappiness is his own fault: for God has made all men to be happy, to be freefrom perturbations. For this purpose he has given means to them, some things toeach person as his own, and other things not as his own: some things subject tohindrance and compulsion and deprivation; and these things are not a man's own:but the things which are not subject to hindrances are his own; and the natureof good and evil, as it was fit to be done by him who takes care of us andprotects us like a father, he has made our own. "But," you say, "I have partedfrom a certain person, and he is grieved." Why did he consider as his own thatwhich belongs to another? why, when he looked on you and was rejoiced, did henot also reckon that you are mortal, that it is natural for you to part fromhim for a foreign country? Therefore he suffers the consequences of his ownfolly. But why do you or for what purpose bewail yourself? Is it that you alsohave not thought of these things? but like poor women who are good for nothing,you have enjoyed all things in which you took pleasure, as if you would alwaysenjoy them, both places and men and conversation; and now you sit and weepbecause you do not see the same persons and do not live in the same places.Indeed you deserve this, to be more wretched than crows and ravens who have thepower of flying where they please and changing their nests for others, andcrossing the seas without lamenting or regretting their former condition. "Yes,but this happens to them because they are irrational creatures." Was reason,then, given to us by the gods for the purpose of unhappiness and misery, thatwe may pass our lives in wretchedness and lamentation? Must all persons beimmortal and must no man go abroad, and must we ourselves not go abroad, butremain rooted like plants; and, if any of our familiar friends go abroad, mustwe sit and weep; and, on the contrary, when he returns, must we dance and clapour hands like children?    Shall we not now wean ourselves and remember what we have heard from thephilosophers? if we did not listen to them as if they were jugglers: they tellus that this world is one city, and the substance out of which it has beenformed is one, and that there must be a certain period, and that some thingsmust give way to others, that some must be dissolved, and others come in theirplace; some to remain in the same place, and others to be moved; and that allthings are full of friendship, first of the gods, and then of men who by natureare made to be of one family; and some must be with one another, and othersmust be separated, rejoicing in those who are with them, and not grieving forthose who are removed from them; and man in addition to being by nature of anoble temper and having a contempt of all things which are not in the power ofhis will, also possesses this property, not to be rooted nor to be naturallyfixed to the earth, but to go at different times to different places, sometimesfrom the urgency of certain occasions, and at others merely for the sake ofseeing. So it was with Ulysses, who saw       Of many men the states, and learned their ways.And still earlier it was the fortune of Hercules to visit all the inhabitedworld       Seeing men's lawless deeds and their good rules of law:casting out and clearing away their lawlessness and introducing in their placegood rules of law. And yet how many friends do you think that he had in Thebes,how many in Argos, how many in Athens? and how many do you think that he gainedby going about? And he married also, when it seemed to him a proper occasion,and begot children, and left them without lamenting or regretting or leavingthem as orphans; for he knew that no man is an orphan; but it is the father whotakes care of all men always and continuously. For it was not as mere reportthat he had heard that Zeus is the father of for he thought that Zeus was hisown father, and he called him so, and to him he looked when he was doing whathe did. Therefore he was enabled to live happily in all places. And it is neverpossible for happiness and desire of what is not present to come together. thatwhich is happy must have all that desires, must resemble a person who is filledwith food, and must have neither thirst nor hunger. "But Ulysses felt a desirefor his wife and wept as he sat on a rock." Do you attend to Homer and hisstories in everything? Or if Ulysses really wept, what was he else than anunhappy man? and what good man is unhappy? In truth, the whole is badlyadministered, if Zeus does not take care of his own citizens that they may behappy like himself. But these things are not lawful nor right to think of: andif Ulysses did weep and lament, he was not a good man. For who is good if heknows not who he is? and who knows what he is, if he forgets that things whichhave been made are perishable, and that it is not possible for one human beingto be with another always? To desire, then, things which are impossible is tohave a slavish character and is foolish: it is the part of a stranger, of a manwho fights against God in the only way that he can, by his opinions.    "But my mother laments when she does not see me." Why has she not learnedthese principles? and I do not say this, that we should not take care that shemay not lament, but I say that we ought not to desire in every way what is notour own. And the sorrow of another is another's sorrow: but my sorrow is myown. I, then, will stop my own sorrow by every means, for it is in my power:and the sorrow of another I will endeavor to stop as far as I can; but I willnot attempt to do it by every means; for if I do, I shall be fighting againstGod, I shall be opposing and shall be placing myself against him in theadministration of the universe; and the reward of this fighting against God andof this disobedience not only will the children of my children pay, but I alsoshall myself, both by day and by night, startled by dreams, perturbed,trembling at every piece of news, and having my tranquillity depending on theletters of others. Some person has arrived from Rome. "I only hope that thereis no harm." But what harm can happen to you, where you are not? From Hellassome one is come: "I hope that there is no harm." In this way every place maybe the cause of misfortune to you. Is it not enough for you to be unfortunatethere where you are, and must you be so even beyond sea, and by the report ofletters? Is this the way in which your affairs are in a state of security?"Well, then, suppose that my friends have died in the places which are far fromme." What else have they suffered than that which is the condition of mortals?Or how are you desirous at the same time to live to old age, and at the sametime not to see the death of any person whom you love? Know you not that in thecourse of a long time many and various kinds of things must happen; that afever shall overpower one, a robber another, and a third a tyrant? Such is thecondition of things around us, such are those who live with us in the world:cold and heat, and unsuitable ways of living, and journeys by land, and voyagesby sea, and winds, and various circumstances which surround us, destroy oneman, and banish another, and throw one upon an embassy and another into anarmy. Sit down, then, in a flutter at all these things, lamenting, unhappy,unfortunate, dependent on another, and dependent not on one or two, but on tenthousands upon ten thousands.    Did you hear this when you were with the philosophers? did you learn this?do you not know that human life is a warfare? that one man must keep watch,another must go out as a spy, and a third must fight? and it is not possiblethat all should be in one place, nor is it better that it be so. But you,neglecting neglecting to do the commands of the general, complain when anythingmore hard than usual is imposed on you, and you do not observe what you makethe army become as far as it is in your power; that if all imitate you, no manwill dig a trench, no man will put a rampart round, nor keep watch, nor exposehimself to danger, but will appear to be useless for the purposes of an army.Again, in a vessel if you go as a sailor, keep to one place and stick to it.And if you are ordered to climb the mast, refuse; if to run to the head of theship, refuse; and what master, of a ship will endure you? and will he not pitchyou overboard as a useless thing, an impediment only and bad example to theother sailors? And so it is here also: every man's life is a kind of warfare,and it is long and diversified. You must observe the duty of a soldier and doeverything at the nod of the general; if it is possible, divining what hiswishes are: for there is no resemblance between that general and this, neitherin strength nor in superiority of character. You are placed in a great officeof command and not in any mean place; but you are always a senator. Do you notknow that such a man must give little time to the affairs of his household, butbe often away from home, either as a governor or one who is governed, ordischarging some office, or serving in war or acting as a judge? Then do youtell me that you wish, as a plant, to be fixed to the same places and to berooted? "Yes, for it is pleasant." Who says that it is not? but a soup ispleasant, and a handsome woman is pleasant. What else do those say who makepleasure their end? Do you not see of what men yon have uttered the language?that it is the language of Epicureans and catamites? Next while you are doingwhat they do and holding their opinions, do you speak to us the words of Zenoand of Socrates? Will you not throw away as far as you can the things belongingto others with which you decorate yourself, though they do not fit you at all?For what else do they desire than to sleep without hindrance and free fromcompulsion, and when they have risen to yawn at their leisure, and to wash theface, then write and read what they choose, and then talk about some triflingmatter being praised by their friends whatever they may say, then to go forthfor a walk, and having walked about a little to bathe, and then eat and sleep,such sleep as is the fashion of such men? why need we say how? for one caneasily conjecture. Come, do you also tell your own way of passing the timewhich you desire, you who are an admirer of truth and of Socrates and Diogenes.What do you wish to do in Athens? the same, or something else? Why then do youcall yourself a Stoic? Well, but they who falsely call themselves Romancitizens, are severely punished; and should those, who falsely claim so greatand reverend a thing and name, get off unpunished? or is this not possible, butthe law divine and strong and inevitable is this, which exacts the severestpunishments from those who commit the greatest crimes? For what does this lawsay? "Let him who pretends to things which do not belong to him be a boaster, avainglorious man: let him who disobeys the divine administration be base, and aslave; let him suffer grief, let him be envious, let him pity; and in a wordlet him be unhappy and lament."    "Well then; do you wish me to pay court to a certain person? to go to hisdoors?" If reason requires this to be done for the sake of country, for thesake of kinsmen, for the sake of mankind, why should you not go? You are notashamed to go to the doors of a shoemaker, when you are in want of shoes, norto the door of a gardener, when you want lettuces; and are you ashamed to go tothe doors of the rich when you want anything? "Yes, for I have no awe of ashoemaker." Don't feel any awe of the rich. "Nor will I flatter the gardener."And do not flatter the rich. "How, then, shall I get what I want?" Do I say toyou, "Go as if you were certain to get what you want"? And do not I only tellyou that you may do what is becoming to yourself? "Why, then, should I stillgo?" That you may have gone, that you may have discharged the duty of acitizen, of a brother, of a friend. And further remember that you have gone tothe shoemaker, to the seller of vegetables, who have no power in anything greator noble, though he may sell dear. You go to buy lettuces: they cost an obolus,but not a talent. So it is here also. The matter is worth going for to the richman's door. Well, I will go. It is worth talking about. Let it be so; I willtalk with him. But you must also kiss his hand and flatter him with praise.Away with that, it is a talent's worth: it is not profitable to me, nor to thestate nor to my friends, to have done that which spoils a good citizen and afriend. "But you seem not to have been eager about the matter, if you do notsucceed." Have you again forgotten why you went? Know you not that a good mandoes nothing for the sake of appearance, but for the sake of doing right? "Whatadvantage is it, then, to him to have done right?" And what advantage is it toa man who writes the name of Dion to write it as he ought? The advantage is tohave written it. "Is there no reward then?" Do you seek a reward for a good mangreater than doing what is good and just? At Olympia you wish for nothing more,but it seems to you enough to be crowned at the games. Does it seem to you sosmall and worthless a thing to be good and happy? For these purposes beingintroduced by the gods into this city, and it being now your duty to undertakethe work of a man, do you still want nurses also and a mamma, and do foolishwomen by their weeping move you and make you effeminate? Will you thus nevercease to be a foolish child? know you not that he who does the acts of a child,the older he is, the more ridiculous he is?    In Athens did you see no one by going to his house? "I visited any man thatI pleased." Here also be ready to see, and you will see whom you please: onlylet it be without meanness, neither with desire nor with aversion, and youraffairs will be well managed. But this result does not depend on going nor onstanding at the doors, but it depends on what is within, on your opinions. Whenyou have learned not to value things which are external, and not dependent onthe will, and to consider that not one of them is your own, but that thesethings only are your own, to exercise the judgment well, to form opinions, tomove toward an object, to desire, to turn from a thing, where is there anylonger room for flattery, where for meanness? why do you still long for thequiet there, and for the places to which you are accustomed? Wait a little andyou will again find these places familiar: then, if you are of so ignoble anature, again if you leave these also, weep and lament.    "How then shall I become of an affectionate temper?" By being of a nobledisposition, and happy. For it is not reasonable to be means-spirited nor tolament yourself, nor to depend on another, nor even to blame God or man. Ientreat you, become an affectionate person in this way, by observing theserules. But if through this affection, as you name it, you are going to be aslave and wretched, there is no profit in being affectionate. And what preventsyou from loving another as a person subject to mortality, as one who may goaway from you. Did not Socrates love his own children? He did; but it was as afree man, as one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the gods. Forthis reason he violated nothing which was becoming to a good man, neither inmaking his defense nor by fixing a penalty on himself, nor even in the formerpart of his life when he was a senator or when be was a soldier. But we arefully supplied with every pretext for being of ignoble temper, some for thesake of a child, some for a mother, and others for brethren's sake. But it isnot fit for us to be unhappy on account of any person, but to be happy onaccount of all, but chiefly on account of God who has made us for this end.Well, did Diogenes love nobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of all thatfor mankind in general he willingly undertook so much labour and bodilysufferings? He did love mankind, but how? As became a minister of God, at thesame time caring for men, and being also subject to God. For this reason allthe earth was his country, and no particular place; and when he was takenprisoner he did not regret Athens nor his associates and friends there, buteven he became familiar with the pirates and tried to improve them; and beingsold afterward he lived in Corinth as before at Athens; and he would havebehaved the same, if he had gone to the country of the Perrhaebi. Thus isfreedom acquired. For this reason he used to say, "Ever since Antisthenes mademe free, I have not been a slave." How did Antisthenes make him free? Hear whathe says: "Antisthenes taught me what is my own, and what is not my own;possessions are not my own, nor kinsmen, domestics, friends, nor reputation,nor places familiar, nor mode of life; all these belong to others." What thenis your own? "The use of appearances. This be showed to me, that I possess itfree from hindrance, and from compulsion, no person can put an obstacle in myway, no person can force me to use appearances otherwise than I wish." Who thenhas any power over me? Philip or Alexander, or Perdiccas or the Great King? Howhave they this power? For if a man is going to be overpowered by a man, he mustlong before be overpowered by things. If, then, pleasure is not able to subduea man, nor pain, nor fame, nor wealth, but he is able, when he chooses, to spitout all his poor body in a man's face and depart from life, whose slave can hestill be? But if he dwelt with pleasure in Athens, and was overpowered by thismanner of life, his affairs would have been at every man's command; thestronger would have had the power of grieving him. How do you think thatDiogenes would have flattered the pirates that they might sell him to someAthenian, that some time he might see that beautiful Piraeus, and the LongWalls and the Acropolis? In what condition would you see them? As a captive, aslave and mean: and what would be the use of it for you? "Not so: but I shouldsee them as a free man." Show me, how you would be free. Observe, some personhas caught you, who leads you away from your accustomed place of abode andsays, "You are my slave, for it is in my power to hinder you from living as youplease, it is in my power to treat you gently, and to humble you: when Ichoose, on the contrary you are cheerful and go elated to Athens." What do yousay to him who treats you as a slave? What means have you of finding one whowill rescue you from slavery? Or cannot you even look him in the face, butwithout saying more do you entreat to be set free? Man, you ought to go gladlyto prison, hastening, going before those who lead you there. Then, I ask you,are you unwilling to live in Rome and desire to live in Hellas? And when youmust die, will you then also fill us with your lamentations, because you willnot see Athens nor walk about in the Lyceion? Have you gone abroad for this?was it for this reason you have sought to find some person from whom you mightreceive benefit? What benefit? That you may solve syllogisms more readily, orhandle hypothetical arguments? and for this reason did you leave brother,country, friends, your family, that you might return when you had learned thesethings? So you did not go abroad to obtain constancy of mind, nor freedom fromperturbation, nor in order that, being secure from harm, you may never complainof any person, accuse no person, and no man may wrong you, and thus you maymaintain your relative position without impediment? This is a fine traffic thatyou have gone abroad for in syllogisms and sophistical arguments andhypothetical: if you like, take your place in the agora and proclaim them forsale like dealers in physic. Will you not deny even all that you have learnedthat you may not bring a bad name on your theorems as useless? What harm hasphilosophy done you? Wherein has Chrysippus injured you that you should proveby your acts that his labours are useless? Were the evils that you had therenot enough, those which were the cause of your pain and lamentation, even ifyou had not gone abroad? Have you added more to the list? And if you again haveother acquaintances and friends, you will have more causes for lamentation; andthe same also if you take an affection for another country. Why, then, do youlive to surround yourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which you areunhappy? Then, I ask you, do you call this affection? What affection, man! Ifit is a good thing, it is the cause of no evil: if it is bad, I have nothing todo with it. I am formed by nature for my own good: I am not formed for my ownevil.    What then is the discipline for this purpose? First of all the highest andthe principal, and that which stands as it were at the entrance, is this; whenyou are delighted with anything, be delighted as with a thing which is not oneof those which cannot be taken away, but as with something of such a kind, asan earthen pot is, or a glass cup, that, when it has been broken, you mayremember what it was and may not be troubled. So in this matter also: if youkiss your own child, or your brother or friend, never give full license to theappearance, and allow not your pleasure to go as far as it chooses; but checkit, and curb it as those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind themthat they are mortal. Do you also remind yourself in like manner, that he whomyou love is mortal, and that what you love is nothing of your own: it has beengiven to you for the present, not that it should not be taken from you, nor hasit been given to you for all time, but as a fig is given to you or a bunch ofgrapes at the appointed season of the year. But if you wish for these things inwinter, you are a fool. So if you wish for your son or friend when it is notallowed to you, you must know that you are wishing for a fig in winter. Forsuch as winter is to a fig, such is every event which happens from the universeto the things which are taken away according to its nature. And further, at thetimes when you are delighted with a thing, place before yourself the contraryappearances. What harm is it while you are kissing your child to say with alisping voice, "To-morrow you will die"; and to a friend also, "To-morrow youwill go away or I shall, and never shall we see one another again"? "But theseare words of bad omen." And some incantations also are of bad omen; but becausethey are useful, I don't care for this; only let them be useful. "But do youcall things to be of bad omen except those which are significant of some evil?"Cowardice is a word of bad omen, and meanness of spirit, and sorrow, and griefand shamelessness. These words are of bad omen: and yet we ought not tohesitate to utter them in order to protect ourselves against the things. Do youtell me that a name which is significant of any natural thing is of evil omen?say that even for the ears of corn to be reaped is of bad omen, for itsignifies the destruction of the ears, but not of the world. Say that thefalling of the leaves also is of bad omen, and for the dried fig to take theplace of the green fig, and for raisins to be made from the grapes. For allthese things are changes from a former state into other states; not adestruction, but a certain fixed economy and administration. Such is going awayfrom home and a small change: such is death, a greater change, not from thestate which now is to that which is not, but to that which is not now. "Shall Ithen no longer exist?" You will not exist, but you be something else, of whichthe world now has need: for you also came into existence not when you chose,but when the world had need of you.    Wherefore the wise and good man, remembering who he is and whence he came,and by whom he was produced, is attentive only to this, how he may fill hisplace with due regularity and obediently to God. "Dost Thou still wish me toexist? I will continue to exist as free, as noble in nature, as Thou hastwished me to exist: for Thou hast made me free from hindrance in that which ismy own. But hast Thou no further need of me? I thank Thee; and so far I haveremained for Thy sake, and for the sake of no other person, and now inobedience to Thee I depart." "How dost thou depart?" Again, I say, as Thou hastpleased, as free, as Thy servant, as one who has known Thy commands and Thyprohibitions. And so long as I shall stay in Thy service, whom dost Thou willme to be? A prince or a private man, a senator or a common person, a soldier ora general, a teacher or a master of a family? whatever place and position Thoumayest assign to me, as Socrates says, "I will die ten thousand times ratherthan desert them." And where dost Thou will me to be? in Rome or Athens, orThebes or Gyara. Only remember me there where I am. If Thou sendest me to aplace where there are no means for men living according to nature, I shall notdepart in disobedience to Thee, but as if Thou wast giving me the signal toretreat: I do not leave Thee, let this be to from my intention, but perceivethat Thou hast no need of me. If means of living according to nature be allowedme, I will seek no other place than that in which I am, or other men than thoseamong whom I am.    Let these thoughts be ready to hand by night and by day: these you shouldwrite, these you should read: about these you should talk to yourself, and toothers. Ask a man, "Can you help me at all for this purpose?" and further, goto another and to another. Then if anything that is said he contrary to yourwish, this reflection first will immediately relieve you, that it is notunexpected. For it is a great thing in all cases to say, "I knew that I begot ason who is mortal." For so you also will say, "I knew that I am mortal, I knewthat I may leave my home, I knew that I may be ejected from it, I knew that Imay be led to prison." Then if you turn round, and look to yourself, and seekthe place from which comes that which has happened, you will forthwithrecollect that it comes from the place of things which are out of the power ofthe will, and of things which are not my own. "What then is it to me?" Then,you will ask, and this is the chief thing: "And who is it that sent it?" Theleader, or the general, the state, the law of the state. Give it me then, for Imust always obey the law in everything. Then, when the appearance pains you,for it is not in your power to prevent this, contend against it by the aid ofreason, conquer it: do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead you to theconsequences by raising images such as it pleases and as it pleases. If you bein Gyara, do not imagine the mode of living at Rome, and how many pleasuresthere were for him who lived there and how many there would be for him whoreturned to Rome: but fix your mind on this matter, how a man who lives inGyara ought to live in Gyara like a man of courage. And if you be in Rome, donot imagine what the life in Athens is, but think only of the life in Rome.    Then in the place of all other delights substitute this, that of beingconscious that you are obeying God, that, not in word but in deed, you areperforming the acts of a wise and good man. For what a thing it is for a man tobe able to say to himself, "Now, whatever the rest may say in solemn manner inthe schools and may be judged to be saying in a way contrary to common opinion,this I am doing; and they are sitting and are discoursing of my virtues andinquiring about me and praising me; and of this Zeus has willed that I shallreceive from myself a demonstration, and shall myself know if He has a soldiersuch as He ought to have, a citizen such as He ought to have, and if He haschosen to produce me to the rest of mankind as a witness of the things whichare independent of the will: 'See that you fear without reason, that youfoolishly desire what you do desire: seek not the good in things external; seekit in yourselves: if you do not, you will not find it.' For this purpose Heleads me at one time hither, at another time sends me thither, shows me to menas poor, without authority, and sick; sends me to Gyara, leads me into prison,not because He hates me, far from him be such a meaning, for who hates the bestof his servants? nor yet because He cares not for me, for He does not neglectany even of the smallest things;' but He does this for the purpose ofexercising me and making use of me as a witness to others. Being appointed tosuch a service, do I still care about the place in which I am, or with whom Iam, or what men say about me? and do I not entirely direct my thoughts to Godand to His instructions and commands?"    Having these things always in hand, and exercising them by yourself, andkeeping them in readiness, you will never be in want of one to comfort you andstrengthen you. For it is not shameful to be without something to eat, but notto have reason sufficient for keeping away fear and sorrow. But if once youhave gained exemption from sorrow and fear, will there any longer be a tyrantfor you, or a tyrant's guard, or attendants on Caesar? Or shall any appointmentto offices at court cause you pain, or shall those who sacrifice in theCapitol, on the occasion of being named to certain functions, cause pain to youwho have received so great authority from Zeus? Only do not make a prouddisplay of it, nor boast of it; but show it by your acts; and if no manperceives it, be satisfied that you are yourself in a healthy state and happy.

To those who fall off from their purpose
</p>

<p>
    Consider as to the things which you proposed to yourself at first, whichyou have secured and which you have not; and how you are pleased when yourecall to memory the one and are pained about the other; and if it is possible,recover the things wherein you failed. For we must not shrink when we areengaged in the greatest combat, but we must even take blows. For the combatbefore us is not in wrestling and the Pancration, in which both the successfuland the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit, or may have little, and intruth may be very fortunate or very unfortunate; but the combat is for goodfortune and happiness themselves. Well then, even if we have renounced thecontest in this matter, no man hinders us from renewing the combat again, andwe are not compelled to wait for another four years that the games at Olympiamay come again; but as soon as you have recovered and restored yourself, andemploy the same zeal, you may renew the combat again; and if again you renounceit, you may again renew it; and if you once gain the victory, you are like himwho has never renounced the combat. Only do not, through a habit of doing thesame thing, begin to do it with pleasure, and then like a bad athlete go aboutafter being conquered in all the circuit of the games like quails who have runaway.    "The sight of a beautiful young girl overpowers me. Well, have I not beenoverpowered before? An inclination arises in me to find fault with a person;for have I not found fault with him before?" You speak to us as if you had comeoff free from harm, just as if a man should say to his physician who forbidshim to bathe, "Have I not bathed before?" If, then, the physician can say tohim, "Well, and what, then, happened to you after the bath? Had you not afever, had you not a headache?" And when you found fault with a person lately,did you not do the act of a malignant person, of a trifling babbler; did younot cherish this habit in you by adding to it the corresponding acts? And whenyou were overpowered by the young girl, did you come off unharmed? Why, then,do you talk of what you did before? You ought, I think, remembering what youdid, as slaves remember the blows which they have received, to abstain from thesame faults. But the one case is not like the other; for in the case of slavesthe pain causes the remembrance: but in the case of your faults, what is thepain, what is the punishment; for when have you been accustomed to fly fromevil acts? Sufferings, then, of the trying character are useful to us, whetherwe choose or not.

To those who fear want

    Are you not ashamed at more cowardly and more mean than fugitive slaves?How do they when they run away leave their masters? on what estates do theydepend, and what domestics do they rely on? Do they not, after stealing alittle which is enough for the first days, then afterward move on through landor through sea, contriving one method after another for maintaining theirlives? And what fugitive slave ever died of hunger? But you are afraid lestnecessary things should fall you, and are sleepless by night. Wretch, are youso blind, and don't you see the road to which the want of necessaries leads?"Well, where does it lead?" To the same place to which a fever leads, or astone that falls on you, to death. Have you not often said this yourself toyour companions? have you not read much of this kind, and written much? and howoften have you boasted that you were easy as to death?    "Yes: but my wife and children also suffer hunger." Well then, does theirhunger lead to any other place? Is there not the same descent to some place forthem also? Is not there the same state below for them? Do you not choose, then,to look to that place full of boldness against every want and deficiency, tothat place to which both the richest and those who have held the highestoffices, and kings themselves and tyrants must descend? or to which you willdescend hungry, if it should so happen, but they burst by indigestion anddrunkenness. What beggar did you hardly ever see who was not an old man, andeven of extreme old age? But chilled with cold day and night, and lying on theground, and eating only what is absolutely necessary they approach near to theimpossibility of dying. Cannot you write? Cannot you teach children? Cannot yoube a watchman at another person's door? "But it is shameful to come to suchnecessity." Learn, then, first what are the things which are shameful, and thentell us that you are a philosopher: but at present do not, even if any otherman call you so, allow it.    Is that shameful to you which is not your own act, that of which you arenot the cause, that which has come to you by accident, as a headache, as afever? If your parents were poor, and left their property to others, and ifwhile they live, they do not help you at all, is this shameful to you? Is thiswhat you learned with the philosophers? Did you never hear that the thing whichis shameful ought to be blamed, and that which is blamable is worthy of blame?Whom do you blame for an act which is not his own, which he did not do himself?Did you, then, make your father such as he is, or is it in your power toimprove him? Is this power given to you? Well then, ought you to wish thethings which are not given to you, or to be ashamed if you do not obtain them?And have you also been accustomed while you were studying philosophy to look toothers and to hope for nothing from yourself? Lament then and groan and eatwith fear that you may not have food to-morrow. Tremble about your poor slaveslest they steal, lest they run away, lest they die. So live, and continue tolive, you who in name only have approached philosophy and have disgraced itstheorems as far as you can by showing them to be useless and unprofitable tothose who take them up; you who have never sought constancy, freedom fromperturbation, and from passions: you who have not sought any person for thesake of this object, but many for the sake of syllogisms; you who have neverthoroughly examined any of these appearances by yourself, "Am I able to bear,or am I not able to bear? What remains for me to do?" But as if all youraffairs were well and secure, you have been resting on the third topic, that ofthings being unchanged, in order that you may possess unchanged- what?cowardice, mean spirit, the admiration of the rich, desire without attainingany end, and avoidance which fails in the attempt? About security in thesethings you have been anxious.    Ought you not to have gained something in addition from reason and, then,to have protected this with security? And whom did you ever see building abattlement all round and not encircling it with a wall? And what doorkeeper isplaced with no door to watch? But you practice in order to be able to prove-what? You practice that you may not be tossed as on the sea through sophisms,and tossed about from what? Show me first what you hold, what you measure, orwhat you weigh; and show me the scales or the medimnus; or how long will you goon measuring the dust? Ought you not to demonstrate those things which make menhappy, which make things go on for them in the way as they wish, and why weought to blame no man, accuse no man, and acquiesce in the administration ofthe universe? Show me these. "See, I show them: I will resolve syllogisms foryou." This is the measure, slave; but it is not the thing measured. Thereforeyou are now paying the penalty for what you neglected, philosophy: you tremble,you lie awake, you advise with all persons; and if your deliberations are notlikely to please all, you think that you have deliberated ill. Then you fearhunger, as you suppose: but it is not hunger that you fear, but you are afraidthat you will not have a cook, that you will not have another to purchaseprovisions for the table, a third to take off your shoes, a fourth to dressyou, others to rub you, and to follow you, in order that in the bath, when youhave taken off your clothes and stretched yourself out like those who arecrucified you may be rubied on this side and on that, and then the aliptes maysay, "Change his position, present the side, take hold of his head, show theshoulder"; and then when you have left the bath and gone home, you may callout, "Does no one bring something to eat?" And then, "Take away the tables,sponge them": you are afraid of this, that you may not be able to lead the lifeof a sick man. But learn the life of those who are in health, how slaves live,how labourers, how those live who are genuine philosophers; how Socrates lived,who had a wife and children; how Diogenes lived, and how Cleanthes, whoattended to the school and drew water. If you choose to have these things, youwill have them everywhere, and you will live in full confidence. Confiding inwhat? In that alone in which a man can confide, in that which is secure, inthat which is not subject to hindrance, in that which cannot be taken away,that is, in your own will. And why have you made yourself so useless and goodfor nothing that no man will choose to receive you into his house, no man totake care of you? but if a utensil entire and useful were cast abroad, everyman who found it would take it up and think it a gain; but no man will take youup, and every man will consider you a loss. So cannot you discharge the officeof a dog, or of a cock? Why then do you choose to live any longer, when you arewhat you are?    Does any good man fear that he shall fall to have food? To the blind itdoes not fall, to the lame it does not: shall it fall to a good man? And to agood soldier there does not fail to one who gives him pay, nor to a labourer,nor to a shoemaker: and to the good man shall there be wanting such a person?Does God thus neglect the things that He has established, His ministers, Hiswitnesses, whom alone He employs as examples to the uninstructed, both that Heexists, and administers well the whole, and does not neglect human affairs, andthat to a good man there is no evil either when he is living or when he isdead? What, then, when He does not supply him with food? What else does He dothan like a good general He has given me the signal to retreat? I obey, Ifollow, assenting to the words of the Commander, praising, His acts: for I camewhen it pleased Him, and I will also go away when it pleases Him; and while Ilived, it was my duty to praise God both by myself, and to each personseverally and to many. He does not supply me with many things, nor withabundance, He does not will me to live luxuriously; for neither did He supplyHercules who was his own son; but another was king of Argos and Mycenae, andHercules obeyed orders, and laboured, and was exercised. And Eurystheus waswhat he was, neither kin, of Argos nor of Mycenae, for he was not even king ofhimself; but Hercules was ruler and leader of the whole earth and sea, whopurged away lawlessness, and introduced justice and holiness; and he did thesethings both naked and alone. And when Ulysses was cast out shipwrecked, didwant humiliate him, did it break his spirit? but how did he go off to thevirgins to ask for necessaries, to beg which is considered most shameful?       As a lion bred in the mountains trusting in his strength.    Relying on what? Not on reputation nor on wealth nor on the power of amagistrate, but on his own strength, that is, on his opinions about the thingswhich are in our power and those which, are not. For these are the only thingswhich make men free, which make them escape from hindrance, which raise thehead of those who are depressed, which make them look with steady eyes on therich and on tyrants. And this was the gift given to the philosopher. But youwill not come forth bold, but trembling about your trifling garments and silvervessels. Unhappy man, have you thus wasted your time till now?    "What, then, if I shall be sick?" You will be sick in such a way as youought to be. "Who will take care of me?" God; your friends. "I shall lie downon a hard bed." But you will lie down like a man. "I shall not have aconvenient chamber." You will be sick in an inconvenient chamber. "Who willprovide for me the necessary food?" Those who provide for others also. You willbe sick like Manes. "And what, also, will be the end of the sickness? Any otherthan death?" Do you then consider that this the chief of all evils to man andthe chief mark of mean spirit and of cowardice is not death, but rather thefear of death? Against this fear then I advise you to exercise yourself: tothis let all your reasoning tend, your exercises, and reading; and you willknow that thus only are men made free.

<p>
About freedom
</p>

<p>
    He is free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject tocompulsion nor to hindrance, nor to force; whose movements to action are notimpeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into thatwhich he would avoid. Who, then, chooses to live in error? No man. Who choosesto live deceived, liable to mistake, unjust, unrestrained, discontented, mean?No man. Not one then of the bad lives as he wishes; nor is he, then, free. Andwho chooses to live in sorrow, fear, envy, pity, desiring and failing in hisdesires, attempting to avoid something and falling into it? Not one. Do we thenfind any of the bad free from sorrow, free from fear, who does not fall intothat which he would avoid, and does not obtain that which he wishes? Not one;nor then do we find any bad man free.    If, then, a man who has been twice consul should hear this, if you add,"But you are a wise man; this is nothing to you": he will pardon you. But ifyou tell him the truth, and say, "You differ not at all from those who havebeen thrice sold as to being yourself not a slave," what else ought you toexpect than blows? For he says, "What, I a slave, I whose father was free,whose mother was free, I whom no man can purchase: I am also of senatorialrank, and a friend of Caesar, and I have been a consul, and I own many slaves."In the first place, most excellent senatorial man, perhaps your father also wasa slave in the same kind of servitude, and your mother, and your grandfatherand all your ancestors in an ascending series. But even if they were as free asit is possible, what is this to you? What if they were of a noble nature, andyou of a mean nature; if they were fearless, and you a coward; if they had thepower of self-restraint, and you are not able to exercise it.    "And what," you may say, "has this to do with being a slave?" Does it seemto you to be nothing to do a thing unwillingly, with compulsion, with groans,has this nothing to do with being a slave? "It is something," you say: "but whois able to compel me, except the lord of all, Caesar?" Then even you yourselfhave admitted that you have one master. But that he is the common master ofall, as you say, let not this console you at all: but know that you are a slavein a great family. So also the people of Nicopolis are used to exclaim, "By thefortune of Caesar, are free."    However, if you please, let us not speak of Caesar at present. But tell methis: did you never love any person, a young girl, or slave, or free? What thenis this with respect to being a slave or free? Were you never commanded by theperson beloved to do something which you did not wish to do? have you neverflattered your little slave? have you never kissed her feet? And yet if any mancompelled you to kiss Caesar's feet, you would think it an insult and excessivetyranny. What else, then, is slavery? Did you never go out by night to someplace whither you did not wish to go, did you not expend what you did not wishto expend, did you not utter words with sighs and groans, did you not submit toabuse and to be excluded? But if you are ashamed to confess your own acts, seewhat Thrasonides says and does, who having seen so much military service asperhaps not even you have, first of all went out by night, when Geta does notventure out, but if he were compelled by his master, would have cried out muchand would have gone out lamenting his bitter slavery. Next, what doesThrasonides say? "A worthless girl has enslaved me, me whom no enemy, everdid." Unhappy man, who are the slave even of a girl, and a worthless girl. Whythen do you still call yourself free? and why do you talk of your service inthe army? Then he calls for a sword and is angry with him who out of kindnessrefuses it; and he sends presents to her who hates him, and entreats and weeps,and on the other hand, having had a little success, he is elated. But even thenhow? was he free enough neither to desire nor to fear?    Now consider in the case of animals, how we employ the notion of liberty.Men keep tame lions shut up, and feed them, and some take them about; and whowill say that this lion is free? Is it not the fact that the more he lives athis ease, so much the more he is in a slavish condition? and who if he hadperception and reason would wish to be one of these lions? Well, these birdswhen they are caught and are kept shut up, how much do they suffer in theirattempts to escape? and some of them die of hunger rather than submit to such akind of life. And as many of them as live, hardly live and with suffering pineaway; and if they ever find any opening, they make their escape. So much dothey desire their natural liberty, and to be independent and free fromhindrance. And what harm is there to you in this? "What do you say? I am formedby nature to fly where I choose, to live in the open air, to sing when Ichoose: you deprive me of all this, and say, 'What harm is it to you?' For thisreason we shall say that those animals only are free which cannot endurecapture, but, as soon as they are caught, escape from captivity by death. SoDiogenes says that there is one way to freedom, and that is to die content: andhe writes to the Persian king, "You cannot enslave the Athenian state any morethan you can enslave fishes." "How is that? cannot I catch them?" "If you catchthem," says Diogenes, "they will immediately leave you, as fishes do; for ifyou catch a fish, it dies; and if these men that are caught shall die, of whatuse to you is the preparation for war?" These are the words of a free man whohad carefully examined the thing and, as was natural, had discovered it. But ifyou look for it in a different place from where it is, what wonder if you neverfind it?    The slave wishes to be set free immediately. Why? Do you think that hewishes to pay money to the collectors of twentieths? No; but because heimagines that hitherto through not having obtained this, he is hindered andunfortunate. "If I shall be set free, immediately it is all happiness, I carefor no man, I speak to all as an equal and, like to them, I go where I choose,I come from any place I choose, and go where I choose." Then he is set free;and forthwith having no place where he can eat, he looks for some man toflatter, some one with whom he shall sup: then he either works with his bodyand endures the most dreadful things; and if he can obtain a manger, he fallsinto a slavery much worse than his former slavery; or even if he is becomerich, being a man without any knowledge of what is good, he loves some littlegirl, and in his happiness laments and desires to be a slave again. He says,"what evil did I suffer in my state of slavery? Another clothed me, anothersupplied me with shoes, another fed me, another looked after me in sickness;and I did only a few services for him. But now a wretched man, what things Isuffer, being a slave of many instead of to one. But however," he says, "if Ishall acquire rings, then I shall live most prosperously and happily." First,in order to acquire these rings, he submits to that which he is worthy of;then, when he has acquired them, it is again all the same. Then he says, "if Ishall be engaged in military service, I am free from all evils." He obtainsmilitary service. He suffers as much as a flogged slave, and nevertheless heasks for a second service and a third. After this, when he has put thefinishing stroke to his career and is become a senator, then he becomes a slaveby entering into the assembly, then he serves the finer and most splendidslavery- not to be a fool, but to learn what Socrates taught, what is thenature of each thing that exists, and that a man should not rashly adaptpreconceptions to the several things which are. For this is the cause to men ofall their evils, the not being able to adapt the general preconceptions to theseveral things. But we have different opinions. One man thinks that he is sick:not so however, but the fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptionsright. Another thinks that he is poor; another that he has a severe father ormother; and another, again, that Caesar is not favourable to him. But all thisis one and only one thing, the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions. Forwho has not a preconception of that which is bad, that it is hurtful, that itought to be avoided, that it ought in every way to be guarded against? Onepreconception is not repugnant to another, only where it comes to the matter ofadaptation. What then is this evil, which is both hurtful, and a thing to beavoided? He answers, "Not to be Caesar's friend." He is gone far from the mark,he has missed the adaptation, he is embarrassed, he seeks the things which arenot at all pertinent to the matter; for when he has succeeded in being Caesar'sfriend, nevertheless he has failed in finding what he sought. For what is thatwhich every man seeks? To live secure, to be happy, to do everything as hewishes, not to be hindered, nor compelled. When then he is become the friend ofCaesar, is he free from hindrance? free from compulsion, is he tranquil, is hehappy? Of whom shall we inquire? What more trustworthy witness have we thanthis very man who is, become Caesar's friend? Come forward and tell us when didyou sleep more quietly, now or before you became Caesar's friend? Immediatelyyou hear the answer, "Stop, I entreat you, and do not mock me: you know notwhat miseries I suffer, and sleep does not come to me; but one comes and says,'Caesar is already awake, he is now going forth': then come troubles andcares." Well, when did you sup with more pleasure, now or before? Hear what hesays about this also. He says that if he is not invited, he is pained: and ifhe is invited, he sups like a slave with his master, all the while beinganxious that he does not say or do anything foolish. And what do you supposethat he is afraid of; lest he should be lashed like a slave? How can he expectanything so good? No, but as befits so great a man, Caesar's friend, he isafraid that he may lose his head. And when did you bathe more free fromtrouble, and take your gymnastic exercise more quietly? In fine, which kind oflife did you prefer? your present or your former life? I can swear that no manis so stupid or so ignorant of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes thenearer he is in friendship to Caesar.    Since, then, neither those who are called kings live as they choose, northe friends of kings, who finally are those who are free? Seek, and you willfind; for you have aids from nature for the discovery of truth. But if you arenot able yourself by going along these ways only to discover that whichfollows, listen to those who have made the inquiry. What do they say? Doesfreedom seem to you a good thing? "The greatest good." Is it possible, then,that he who obtains the greatest good can be unhappy or fare badly? "No."Whomsoever, then, you shall see unhappy, unfortunate, lamenting, confidentlydeclare that they are not free. "I do declare it." We have now, then, got awayfrom buying and selling and from such arrangements about matters of property;for if you have rightly assented to these matters, if the Great King isunhappy, he cannot be free, nor can a little king, nor a man of consular rank,nor one who has been twice consul. "Be it so."    Further, then, answer me this question also: Does freedom seem to you to besomething great and noble and valuable? "How should it not seem so?" Is itpossible, then, when a man obtains anything, so great and valuable and noble tobe mean? "It is not possible." When, then, you see any man subject to another,or flattering him contrary to his own opinion, confidently affirm that this manalso is not free; and not only if he do this for a bit of supper, but also ifhe does it for a government or a consulship: and call these men "little slaves"who for the sake of little matters do these things, and those who do so for thesake of great things call "great slaves," as they deserve to be. "This isadmitted also." Do you think that freedom is a thing independent andself-governing? "Certainly." Whomsoever, then, it is in the power of another tohinder and compel, declare that he is not free. And do not look, I entreat you,after his grandfathers and great-grandfathers, or inquire about his beingbought or sold; but if you hear him saying from his heart and with feeling,"Master," even if the twelve fasces precede him, call him a slave. And if youhear him say, "Wretch that I am, how much I suffer," call him a slave. If,finally, you see him lamenting, complaining, unhappy, call him a slave thoughhe wears a praetexta. If, then, he is doing nothing of this kind, do not yetsay that he is free, but learn his opinions, whether they are subject tocompulsion, or may produce hindrance, or to bad fortune; and if you find himsuch, call him a slave who has a holiday in the Saturnalia: say that his masteris from home: he will return soon, and you will know what he suffers. "Who willreturn?" Whoever has in himself the power over anything which is desired by theman, either to give it to him or to take it away? "Thus, then, have we manymasters?" We have: for we have circumstances as masters prior to our presentmasters; and these circumstances are many. Therefore it must of necessity bethat those who have the power over any of these circumstances must be ourmasters. For no man fears Caesar himself, but he fears death, banishment,deprivation of his property, prison, and disgrace. Nor does any man loveCaesar, unless Caesar is a person of great merit, but he loves wealth, theoffice of tribune, praetor or consul. When we love, and hate, and fear thesethings, it must be that those who have the power over them must be our masters.Therefore we adore them even as gods; for we think that what possesses thepower of conferring the greatest advantage on us is divine. Then we wronglyassume that a certain person has the power of conferring the greatestadvantages; therefore he is something divine. For if we wrongly assume that acertain person has the power of conferring the greatest advantages, it is anecessary consequence that the conclusion from these premises must be false.    What, then, is that which makes a man free from hindrance and makes him hisown master? For wealth does not do it, nor consulship, nor provincialgovernment, nor royal power; but something else must be discovered. What thenis that which, when we write, makes us free from hindrance and unimpeded? "Theknowledge of the art of writing." What, then, is it in playing the lute? "Thescience of playing the lute." Therefore in life also it is the science of life.You have, then, heard in a general way: but examine the thing also in theseveral parts. Is it possible that he who desires any of the things whichdepend on others can be free from hindrance? "No." Is it possible for him to beunimpeded? "No." Therefore he cannot be free. Consider then: whether we havenothing which is in our own power only, or whether we have all things, orwhether some things are in our own power, and others in the power of others."What do you mean?" When you wish the body to be entire, is it in your power ornot? "It is not in my power." When you wish it to be healthy? "Neither is thisin my power." When you wish it to be handsome? "Nor is this." Life or death?"Neither is this in my power." Your body, then, is another's, subject to everyman who is stronger than yourself? "It is." But your estate, is it in yourpower to have it when you please, and as long as you please, and such as youplease? "No." And your slaves? "No." And your clothes? "No." And your house?"No." And your horses? "Not one of these things." And if you wish by all meansyour children to live, or your wife, or your brother, or your friends, is it inyour power? "This also is not in my power."    Whether, then, have you nothing which is in your own power, which dependson yourself only and cannot be taken from you, or have you anything of thekind? "I know not." Look at the thing, then, thus, examine it. Is any man ableto make you assent to that which is false? "No man." In the matter of assent,then, you are free from hindrance and obstruction. "Granted." Well; and can aman force you to desire to move toward that to which you do not choose? "Hecan, for when he threatens me with death or bonds, he compels me to desire tomove toward it." If, then, you despise death and bonds, do you still pay anyregard to him? "No." Is, then, the despising of death an act of your own, or isit not yours? "It is my act." It is your own act, then, also to desire to movetoward a thing: or is it not so? "It is my own act." But to desire to move awayfrom a thing, whose act is that? This also is your act. "What, then, if I haveattempted to walk, suppose another should hinder me." What part of you does hehinder? does he hinder the faculty of assent? "No: but my poor body." Yes, ashe would do with a stone. "Granted; but I no longer walk." And who told youthat walking is your act free from hindrance? for I said that this only wasfree from hindrance, to desire to move: but where there is need of body and itsco-operation, you have heard long ago that nothing is your own. "Granted also."And who can compel you to desire what you do not wish? "No man." And topropose, or intend, or in short to make use of the appearances which presentthemselves, can any man compel you? "He cannot do this: but he will hinder mewhen I desire from obtaining what I desire." If you desire anything which isyour own, and one of the things which cannot be hindered, how will he hinderyou? "He cannot in any way." Who, then, tells you that he who desires thethings that belong to another is free from hindrance?    "Must I, then, not desire health?" By no means, nor anything else thatbelongs to another: for what is not in your power to acquire or to keep whenyou please, this belongs to another. Keep, then, far from it not only yourhands but, more than that, even your desires. If you do not, you havesurrendered yourself as a slave; you have subjected your neck, if you admireanything not your own, to everything that is dependent on the power of othersand perishable, to which you have conceived a liking. "Is not my hand my own?"It is a part of your own body; but it is by nature earth, subject to hindrance,compulsion, and the slave of everything which is stronger. And why do I sayyour hand? You ought to possess your whole body as a poor ass loaded, as longas it is possible, as long as you are allowed. But if there be a press, and asoldier should lay hold of it, let it go, do not resist, nor murmur; if you do,you will receive blows, and nevertheless you will also lose the ass. But whenyou ought to feel thus with respect to the body, consider what remains to bedone about all the rest, which is provided for the sake of the body. When thebody is an ass, all the other things are bits belonging to the ass,pack-saddles, shoes, barley, fodder. Let these also go: get rid of them quickerand more readily than of the ass.    When you have made this preparation, and have practiced this discipline, todistinguish that which belongs to another from that which is your own, thethings which are subject to hindrance from those which are not, to consider thethings free from hindrance to concern yourself, and those which are not freenot to concern yourself, to keep your desire steadily fixed to the things whichdo concern yourself, and turned from the things which do not concern yourself;do you still fear any man? "No one." For about what will you be afraid? aboutthe things which are your own, in which consists the nature of good and evil?and who has power over these things? who can take them away? who can impedethem? No man can, no more than he can impede God. But will you be afraid aboutyour body and your possessions, about things which are not yours, about thingswhich in no way concern you? and what else have you been studying from thebeginning than to distinguish between your own and not your own, the thingswhich are in your power and not in your power, the things subject to hindranceand not subject? and why have you come to the philosophers? was it that you maynevertheless be unfortunate and unhappy? You will then in this way, as I havesupposed you to have done, be without fear and disturbance. And what is griefto you? for fear comes from what you expect, but grief from that which ispresent. But what further will you desire? For of the things which are withinthe power of the will, as being good and present, you have a proper andregulated desire: but of the things which are not in the power of the will youdo not desire any one, and so you do not allow any place to that which isirrational, and impatient, and above measure hasty.    When, then, you are thus affected toward things, what man can any longer beformidable to you? For what has a man which is formidable to another, eitherwhen you see him or speak to him or, finally, are conversant with him? Not morethan one horse has with respect to another, or one dog to another, or one beeto another bee. Things, indeed, are formidable to every man; and when any manis able to confer these things on another or to take them away, then he toobecomes formidable. How then is an acropolis demolished? Not by the sword, notby fire, but by opinion. For if we abolish the acropolis which is in the city,can we abolish also that of fever, and that of beautiful women? Can we, in aword, abolish the acropolis which is in us and cast out the tyrants within us,whom we have dally over us, sometimes the same tyrants, at other timesdifferent tyrants? But with this we must begin, and with this we must demolishthe acropolis and eject the tyrants, by giving up the body, the parts of it,the faculties of it, the possessions, the reputation, magisterial offices,honours, children, brothers, friends, by considering all these things asbelonging to others. And if tyrants have been ejected from us, why do I stillshut in the acropolis by a wall of circumvallation, at least on my account; forif it still stands, what does it do to me? why do I still eject guards? Forwhere do I perceive them? against others they have their fasces, and theirspears, and their swords. But I have never been hindered in my will, norcompelled when I did not will. And how is this possible? I have placed mymovements toward action in obedience to God. Is it His will that I shall havefever? It is my will also. Is it His will that I should move toward anything?It is my will also. Is it His will that I should obtain anything? It is my wishalso. Does He not will? I do not wish. Is it His will that I be put to therack? It is my will then to die; it is my will then to be put to the rack. Who,then, is still able to hinder me contrary to my own judgement, or to compel me?No more than he can hinder or compel Zeus.    Thus the more cautious of travelers also act. A traveler has heard that theroad is infested by robbers; he does not venture to enter on it alone, but hewaits for the companionship on the road either of an ambassador, or of aquaestor, or of a proconsul, and when he has attached himself to such personshe goes along the road safely. So in the world the wise man acts. There aremany companies of robbers, tyrants, storms, difficulties, losses of that whichis dearest. "Where is there any place of refuge? how shall he pass alongwithout being attacked by robbers? what company shall he wait for that he maypass along in safety? to whom shall he attach himself? To what persongenerally? to the rich man, to the man of consular rank? and what is the use ofthat to me? Such a man is stripped himself, groans and laments. But what if thefellow-companion himself turns against me and becomes my robber, what shall Ido? I will be 'a friend of Caesar': when I am Caesar's companion no man willwrong me. In the first place, that I may become illustrious, what things must Iendure and suffer? how often and by how many must I he robbed? Then, if Ibecome Caesar's friend, he also is mortal. And if Caesar from any circumstancebecomes my enemy, where is it best for me to retire? Into a desert? Well, doesfever not come there? What shall be done then? Is it not possible to find asafe fellow traveler, a faithful one, strong, secure against all surprises?"Thus he considers and perceives that if he attaches himself to God, he willmake his journey in safety.    "How do you understand 'attaching yourself to God'?" In this sense, thatwhatever God wills, a man also shall will; and what God does not will, a manshall not will. How, then, shall this he done? In what other way than byexamining the movements of God and his administration What has He given to meas my own and in my own power? what has He reserved to Himself? He has given tome the things which are in the power of the will: He has put them in my powerfree from impediment and hindrance. How was He able to make the earthly bodyfree from hindrance? And accordingly He has subjected to the revolution of thewhole, possessions, household things, house, children, wife. Why, then, do Ifight against God? why do I will what does not depend on the will? why do Iwill to have absolutely what is not granted to ma? But how ought I to will tohave things? In the way in which they are given and as long as they are given.But He who has given takes away. Why then do I resist? I do not say that Ishall be fool if I use force to one who is stronger, but I shall first beunjust. For whence had I things when I came into the world? My father gave themto me. And who gave them to him? and who made the sun? and who made the fruitsof the earth? and who the seasons? and who made the connection of men with oneanother and their fellowship?    Then after receiving everything from another and even yourself, are youangry and do you blame the Giver if he takes anything from you? Who are you,and for what purpose did you come into the world? Did not He introduce youhere, did He not show you the light, did he not give you fellow-workers, andperception, and reason? and as whom did He introduce you here? did He notintroduce you as a subject to death, and as one to live on the earth with alittle flesh, and to observe His administration, and to join with Him in thespectacle and the festival for a short time? Will you not, then, as long as youhave been permitted, after seeing the spectacle and the solemnity, when heleads you out, go with adoration of Him and thanks for what you have seen, andheard? "No; but I would, still enjoy the feast." The initiated, too, would wishto be longer in the initiation: and perhaps also those, at Olympia to see otherathletes; but the solemnity is ended: go away like a grateful and modest man;make room for others: others also must be born, as you were, and being bornthey must have a place, and houses and necessary things. And if the first donot retire, what remains? Why ire you insatiable? Why are you not content? whydo you contract the world? "Yes, but I would have my little children with meand my wife." What, are they yours? do they not belong to the Giver, and to Himwho made you? then will you not give up what belongs to others? will you notgive way to Him who is superior? "Why, then, did He introduce me into the worldon these conditions," And if the conditions do not suit you depart. He has noneed of a spectator who is not satisfied. He wants those who join in thefestival, those who take part in the chorus, that they may rather applaud,admire, and celebrate with hymns the solemnity. But those who can bear notrouble, and the cowardly He will not willingly see absent from the greatassembly; for they did not when they were present behave as they ought to do ata festival nor fill up their place properly, but they lamented, found faultwith the deity, fortune, their companions; not seeing both what they had. andtheir own powers, which they received for contrary purposes, the powers ofmagnanimity, of a generous mind, manly spirit, and what we are now inquiringabout, freedom. "For what purpose, then, have I received these things? To usethem. "How long;" So long as He who his lent them chooses. "What if they arenecessary to me?" Do not attach yourself to them and they will not benecessary: do not say to yourself that they are necessary, and then they arenot necessary.    This study you ought to practice from morning to evening, beginning, withthe smallest things and those most liable to damage, with an earthen pot, witha cup. Then proceed in this way to a tunic to a little dog, to a horse, to asmall estate in land: then to yourself, to your body, to the parts of yourbody, to your brothers. Look all round and throw these things from you. Purgeyour opinions so that nothing cleave to you of the things which are not yourown, that nothing grow to you, that nothing give you pain when it is torn fromyou; and say, while you are daily exercising yourself as you do there, not thatyou are philosophizing, for this is an arrogant expression, but that you arepresenting an asserter of freedom: for this is really freedom. To this freedomDiogenes was called by Antisthenes, and he said that he could no longer beenslaved by any man. For this reason when he was taken prisoner, how did hebehave to the pirates? Did he call any of them master? and I do not speak ofthe name, for I am not afraid of the word, but of the state of mind by whichthe word is produced. How did he reprove them for feeding badly their captives?How was he sold? Did he seek a master? no; but a slave, And, when he was sold,how did he behave to his master? Immediately he disputed with him and said tohis master that he ought not to be dressed as he was, nor shaved in such amanner; and about the children he told them how he ought to bring them up. Andwhat was strange in this? for if his master had bought an exercise master,would he have employed him in the exercises of the palaestra as a servant or asa master? and so if he had bought a physician or an architect. And so, in everymatter, it is absolutely necessary that he who has skill must be the superiorof him who has not. Whoever, then, generally possesses the science of life,what else must he be than master? For who is master of a ship? "The man whogoverns the helm." Why? Because he who will not obey him suffers for it. "But amaster can give me stripes." Can he do it, then, without suffering for it?' "SoI also used to think." But because he can not do it without suffering for it,for this reason it is not in his power: and no man can do what is unjustwithout suffering for it. "And what is the penalty for him who puts his ownslave in chains, what do you think that is?" The fact of putting the slave inchains: and you also will admit this, if you choose to maintain the truth, thatman is not a wild beast, but a tame animal. For when is a a vine doing badly?When it is in a condition contrary to its nature. When is a cock? Just thesame. Therefore a man also is so. What then is a man's nature? To bite, tokick, and to throw into prison and to behead? No; but to do good, to co-operatewith others, to wish them well. At that time, then, he is in a bad condition,whether you choose to admit it or not, when he is acting foolishly.    "Socrates, then, did not fare badly?" No; but his judges aid his accusersdid. "Nor did Helvidius at Rome fare badly?" No; but his murderer did. "How doyou mean?" The same as you do when you say that a cock has not fared badly whenhe has gained the victory and been severely wounded; but that the cock hasfared badly when he has been defeated and is unhurt: nor do you call a dogfortunate who neither pursues game nor labors, but when you see him sweating,when you see him in pain and panting violently after running. What paradox dowe utter if we say that the evil in everything's that which is contrary to thenature of the thing? Is that a paradox? for do you not say this in the case ofall other things? Why then in the case of man only do you think differently,But because we say that the nature of man is tame and social and faithful, youwill not say that this is a paradox? "It is not." What then is it a paradox tosay that a man is not hurt when he is whipped, or put in chains, or beheaded?does he not, if he suffers nobly, come off even with increased advantage andprofit? But is he not hurt, who suffers in a most pitiful and disgraceful way,who in place of a man becomes a wolf, or viper or wasp?    Well then let us recapitulate the things which have been agreed on. The manwho is not under restraint is free, to whom things are exactly in that state inwhich he wishes them to be; but he who can be restrained or compelled orhindered, or thrown into any circumstances against his will, is a slave. Butwho is free from restraint? He who desires nothing that belongs to others. Andwhat are the things which belong to others? Those which are not in our powereither to have or not to have, or to have of a certain kind or in a certainmanner. Therefore the body belongs to another, the parts of the body belong toanother, possession belongs to another. If, then, you are attached to any ofthese things as your own, you will pay the penalty which it is proper for himto pay who desires what belongs to another. This road leads to freedom, that isthe only way of escaping from slavery, to be able to say at last with all yoursoul
       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O destiny,       The way that I am bid by you to go.But what do you say, philosopher? The tyrant summons you to say something whichdoes not become you. Do you say it or do you not? Answer me. "Let me consider."Will you consider now? But when you were in the school, what was it which youused to consider? Did you not study what are the things that are good and whatare bad, and what things are neither one nor the other? "I did." What then wasour opinion? "That just and honourable acts were good; and that unjust anddisgraceful acts were bad." Is life a good thing? "No." Is death a bad thing?"No." Is prison? "No." But what did we think about mean and faithless words andbetrayal of a friend and flattery of a tyrant? "That they are bad." Well then,you are not considering, nor have you considered nor deliberated. For what isthe matter for consideration: is it whether it is becoming for me, when I haveit in my power, to secure for myself the greatest of good things, and not tosecure for myself the greatest evils? A fine inquiry indeed, and necessary, andone that demands much deliberation. Man, why do you mock us? Such an inquiry isnever made. If you really imagined that base things were bad and honourablethings were good, and that all other things were neither good nor bad, youwould not even have approached this inquiry, nor have come near it; butimmediately you would have been able to distinguish them by the understandingas you would do by the vision. For when do you inquire if black things arewhite, if heavy things are light, and do not comprehend the manifest evidenceof the senses? How, then, do you now say that you are considering whetherthings which are neither good nor bad ought to be avoided more than thingswhich are bad? But you do not possess these opinions; and neither do thesethings seem to you to he neither good nor bad, but you think that they are thegreatest evils; nor do you think those other things to be evils, but matterswhich do not concern us at all. For thus from the beginning you have accustomedyourself. "Where am I? In the schools: and are any listening to me? I amdiscoursing among philosophers. But I have gone out of the school. Away withthis talk of scholars and fools." Thus a friend is overpowered by the testimonyof a philosopher: thus a philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets himselffor hire for money: thus in the senate a man does not say what he thinks; inprivate he proclaims his opinions. You are a cold and miserable little opinion,suspended from idle words as from a hair. But keep yourself strong and fit forthe uses of life and initiated by being exercised in action. How do you hear? Ido not say that your child is dead- for how could you bear that?- but that youroil is spilled, your wine drunk up. Do you act in such a way that one standingby you while you are making a great noise, may say this only, "Philosopher, yousay something different in the school. Why do you deceive us? Why, when you areonly a worm, do you say that you are a man?" I should like to be present whenone of the philosophers is lying with a woman, that I might see how he isexerting himself, and what words he is uttering, and whether he remembers histitle of philosopher, and the words which he hears or says or reads.    "And what is this to liberty?" Nothing else than this, whether you who arerich choose or not. "And who is your evidence for this?" who else thanyourselves? who have a powerful master, and who live in obedience to his nodand motion, and who faint if he only looks at you with a scowling countenance;you who court old women and old men, and say, "I cannot do this: it is not inmy power." Why is it not in your power? Did you not lately contend with me andsay that you are free "But Aprulla has hindered me." Tell the truth, then,slave, and do not run away from your masters, nor deny, nor venture to produceany one to assert your freedom, when you have so many evidences of yourslavery. And indeed when a man is compelled by love to do something contrary tohis opinion, and at the same time sees the better but has not the strength tofollow it, one might consider him still more worthy of excuse as being held bya certain violent and, in a manner, a divine power. But who could endure youwho are in love with old women and old men, and wipe the old women's noses, andwash them and give them presents, and also wait on them like a slave when theyare sick, and at the same time wish them dead, and question the physicianswhether they are sick unto death? And again, when in order to obtain thesegreat and much admired magistracies and honours, you kiss the hands of theseslaves of others, and so you are not the slave even of free men. Then you walkabout before me in stately fashion, praetor or a consul. Do I not know how youbecame a praetor, by what means you got your consulship, who gave it to you? Iwould not even choose to live, if I must live by help of Felicion and endurehis arrogance and servile insolence: for I know what a slave is, who isfortunate, as he thinks, and puffed up by pride.    "You then," a man may say, "are you free?" I wish, by the Gods, and pray tobe free; but I am not yet able to face my masters, I still value my poor body,I value greatly the preservation of it entire, though I do not possess itentire. But I can point out to you a free man, that you may no longer seek anexample. Diogenes was free. How was he free?- not because he was born of freeparents, but because he was himself free, because he had cast off all thehandles of slavery, and it was not possible for any man to approach him, norhad any man the means of laying hold of him to enslave him. He had everythingeasily loosed, everything only hanging to him. If you laid hold of hisproperty, he would rather have let it go and be yours than he would havefollowed you for it: if you had laid hold of his leg, he would have let go hisleg; if of all his body, all his poor body; his intimates, friends, country,just the same. For he knew from whence he had them, and from whom, and on whatconditions. His true parents indeed, the Gods, and his real country he wouldnever have deserted, nor would he have yielded to any man in obedience to themor to their orders, nor would any man have died for his country more readily.For he was not used to inquire when he should be considered to have doneanything on behalf of the whole of things, but he remembered that everythingwhich is done comes from thence and is done on behalf of that country and iscommanded by him who administers it. Therefore see what Diogenes himself saysand writes: "For this reason," he says, "Diogenes, it is in your power to speakboth with the King of the Persians and with Archidamus the king of theLacedaemonians, as you please." Was it because he was born of free parents? Isuppose all the Athenians and all the Lacedaemonians, because they were born ofslaves, could not talk with them as they wished, but feared and paid court tothem. Why then does he say that it is in his power? "Because I do not considerthe poor body to be my own, because I want nothing, because law is everythingto me, and nothing else is." These were the things which permitted him to befree.    And that you may not think that I show you the example of a man who is asolitary person, who has neither wife nor children, nor country, nor friendsnor kinsmen, by whom he could be bent and drawn in various directions, takeSocrates and observe that he had a wife and children, but he did not considerthem as his own; that he had a country, so long as it was fit to have one, andin such a manner as was fit; friends and kinsmen also, but he held all insubjection to law and to the obedience due to it. For this reason he was thefirst to go out as a soldier, when it was necessary; and in war he exposedhimself to danger most unsparingly, and when he was sent by the tyrants toseize Leon, he did not even deliberate about the matter, because he thoughtthat it was a base action, and he knew that he must die, if it so happened. Andwhat difference did that make to him? for he intended to preserve somethingelse, not his poor flesh, but his fidelity, his honourable character. These arethings which could not be assailed nor brought into subjection. Then, when hewas obliged to speak in defense of his life, did he behave like a man who hadchildren, who had a wife? No, but he behaved like a man who has neither. Andwhat did he do when he was to drink the poison, and when he had the power ofescaping from prison, and when Crito said to him, "Escape for the sake of yourchildren," what did Socrates say? Did he consider the power of escape as anunexpected gain? By no means: he considered what was fit and proper; but therest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning. For he did not choose,he said, to save his poor body, but to save that which is increased and savedby doing what is just, and is impaired and destroyed by doing what is unjust.Socrates will not save his life by a base act; he who would not put theAthenians to the vote when they clamoured that he should do so, he who refusedto obey the tyrants, he who discoursed in such a manner about virtue and rightbehavior. It is not possible to save such a man's life by base acts, but he issaved by dying, not by running away. For the good actor also preserves hischaracter by stopping when he ought to stop, better than when he goes on actingbeyond the proper time. What then shall the children of Socrates do? "If," saidSocrates, "I had gone off to Thessaly, would you have taken care of them; andif I depart to the world below, will there be no man to take care of them?" Seehow he gives to death a gentle name and mocks it. But if you and I had been inhis place, we should have immediately answered as philosophers that those whoact unjustly must be repaid in the same way, and we should have added, "I shallbe useful to many, if my life is saved, and if I die, I shall be useful to noman." For, if it had been necessary, we should have made our escape by slippingthrough a small hole. And how in that case should we have been useful to anyman? for where would they have been then staying? or if we were useful to menwhile we were alive, should we not have been much more useful to them by dyingwhen we ought to die, and as we ought? And now, Socrates being dead, no lessuseful to men, and even more useful, is the remembrance of that which he did orsaid when he was alive.    Think of these things, these opinions, these words: look to these examples,if you would be free, if you desire the thing according to its worth. And whatis the wonder if you buy so great a thing at the price of things so many and sogreat? For the sake of this which is called "liberty," some hang themselves,others throw themselves down precipices, and sometimes even whole cities haveperished: and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable and secureliberty give back to God when He demands them the things which He has given?Will you not, as Plato says, study not to die only, but also to endure torture,and exile, and scourging, and, in a word, to give up all which is not your own?If you will not, you will be a slave among slaves, even you be ten thousandtimes a consul; and if you make your way up to the Palace, you will no less bea slave; and you will feel, that perhaps philosophers utter words which arecontrary to common opinion, as Cleanthes also said, but not words contrary toreason. For you will know by experience that the words are true, and that thereis no profit from the things which are valued and eagerly sought to those whohave obtained them; and to those who have not yet obtained them there is animagination that when these things are come, all that is good will come withthem; then, when they are come, the feverish feeling is the same, the tossingto and fro is the same, the satiety, the desire of things which are notpresent; for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the things whichare desired, but by removing the desire. And that you may know that this istrue, as you have laboured for those things, so transfer your labour to these;be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion which will make you free;pay court to a philosopher instead of to a rich old man: be seen about aphilosopher's doors: you will not disgrace yourself by being seen; you will notgo away empty nor without profit, if you go to the philosopher as you ought,and if not, try at least: the trial is not disgraceful.

On familiar intimacy
</p>

<p>
    To This matter before all you must attend: that you be never so closelyconnected with any of your former intimates or friends as to come down to thesame acts as he does. If you do not observe this rule, you will ruin yourself.But if the thought arises in your mind. "I shall seem disobliging to him, andhe will not have the same feeling toward me," remember that nothing is donewithout cost, nor is it possible for a man if he does not do the same to be thesame man that he was. Choose, then, which of the two you will have, to beequally loved by those by whom you were formerly loved, being the same withyour former self; or, being superior, not to obtain from your friends the samethat you did before. For if this is better, turn away to it, and let not otherconsiderations draw you in a different direction. For no man is able to makeprogress, when he is wavering between opposite things, but if you havepreferred this to all things, if you choose to attend to this only, to work outthis only, give up everything else. But if you will not do this, your waveringwill produce both these results: you will neither improve as you ought, norwill you obtain what you formerly obtained. For before, by plainly desiring thethings which were worth nothing, you pleased your associates. But you cannotexcel in both kinds, and it is necessary that so far as you share in the one,you must fall short in the other. You cannot, when you do not drink with thosewith whom you used to drink, he agreeable to them as you were before. Choose,then, whether you will be a hard drinker and pleasant to your former associatesor a sober man and disagreeable to them. You cannot, when you do not sing withthose with whom you used to sing, be equally loved by them. Choose, then, inthis matter also which of the two you will have. For if it is better to bemodest and orderly than for a man to say, "He is a jolly fellow," give up therest, renounce it, turn away from it, have nothing to do with such men. But ifthis behavior shall not please you, turn altogether to the opposite: become acatamite, an adulterer, and act accordingly, and you will get what you wish.And jump up in the theatre and bawl out in praise of the dancer. But charactersso different cannot be mingled: you cannot act both Thersites and Agamemnon. Ifyou intend to be Thersites, you must be humpbacked and bald: if Agamemnon, youmust be tall and handsome, and love those who are placed in obedience to you.

What things we should exchange for other things
</p>

<p>
    Keep this thought in readiness, when you lose anything external, what youacquire in place of it; and if it be worth more, never say, "I have had aloss"; neither if you have got a horse in place of an ass, or an ox in place ofa sheep, nor a good action in place of a bit of money, nor in place of idletalk such tranquillity as befits a man, nor in place of lewd talk if you haveacquired modesty. If you remember this, you will always maintain your charactersuch as it ought to be. But if you do not, consider that the times ofopportunity are perishing, and that whatever pains you take about yourself, youare going to waste them all and overturn them. And it needs only a few thingsfor the loss and overturning of all, namely a small deviation from reason. Forthe steerer of a ship to upset it, he has no need of the same means as he hasneed of for saving it: but if he turns it a little to the wind, it is lost; andif he does not do this purposely, but has been neglecting his duty a little,the ship is lost. Something of the kind happens in this case also: if you onlyfall to nodding a little, all that you have up to this time collected is gone.Attend therefore to the appearances of things, and watch over them; for thatwhich you have to preserve is no small matter, but it is modesty and fidelityand constancy, freedom from the affects, a state of mind undisturbed, freedomfrom fear, tranquillity, in a word, "liberty." For what will you sell thesethings? See what is the value of the things which you will obtain in exchangefor these. "But shall I not obtain any such thing for it?" See, and if you doin return get that, see what you receive in place of it. "I possess decency, hepossesses a tribuneship: be possesses a praetorship, I possess modesty. But Ido not make acclamations where it is not becoming: I will not stand up where Iought not; for I am free, and a friend of God, and so I obey Him willingly. ButI must not claim anything else, neither body nor possession, nor magistracy,nor good report, nor in fact anything. For He does not allow me to claim them:for if He had chosen, He would have made them good for me; but He has not doneso, and for this reason I cannot transgress his commands." Preserve that whichis your own good in everything; and as to every other thing, as it ispermitted, and so far as to behave consistently with reason in respect to them,content with this only. If you do not, you will be unfortunate, you will fallin all things, you will be hindered, you will be impeded. These are the lawswhich have been sent from thence; these are the orders. Of these laws a manought to be an expositor, to these he ought to submit, not to those of Masuriusand Cassius.

<p>
To those who are desirous of passing life in tranquility
</p>

<p>
    Remember that not only the desire of power and of riches makes us mean andsubject to others, but even the desire of tranquillity, and of leisure. and oftraveling abroad, and of learning. For, to speak plainly, whatever the externalthing may be, the value which we set upon it places us in subjection to others.What, then, is the difference between desiring, to be a senator or not desiringto be one; what is the difference between desiring power or being content witha private station; what is the difference between saying, "I am unhappy, I havenothing, to do, but I am bound to my books as a corpse"; or saying, "I amunhappy, I have no leisure for reading"? For as salutations and power arethings external and independent of the will, so is a book. For what purpose doyou choose to read? Tell me. For if you only direct your purpose to beingamused or learning something, you are a silly fellow and incapable of enduringlabour. But if you refer reading to the proper end, what else is this than atranquil and happy life? But if reading does not secure for you a happy andtranquil life, what is the use of it? But it does secure this," the manreplies, "and for this reason I am vexed that I am deprived of it." And what isthis tranquil and happy life, which any man can impede; I do not say Caesar orCaesar's friend, but a crow, a piper, a fever, and thirty thousand otherthings? But a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure is continuityand freedom from obstacle. Now I am called to do something: I will go, then,with the purpose of observing the measures which I must keep, of acting withmodesty, steadiness, without desire and aversion to things external; and thenthat I may attend to men, what they say, how they are moved; and this not withany bad disposition, or that I may have something to blame or to ridicule; butI turn to myself, and ask if I also commit the same faults. "How then shall Icease to commit them?" Formerly I also acted wrong, but now I do not: thanks toGod.
    Come, when you have done these things and have attended to them, have youdone a worse act than when you have read a thousand verses or written as many?For when you eat, are you grieved because you are not reading? are you notsatisfied with eating according to what you have learned by reading, and sowith bathing and with exercise? Why, then, do you not act consistently in allthings, both when you approach Caesar and when you approach any person? If youmaintain yourself free from perturbation, free from alarm, and steady; if youlook rather at the things which are done and happen than are looked atyourself; if you do not envy those who are preferred before you; if surroundingcircumstances do not strike you with fear or admiration, what do you want?Books? How or for what purpose? for is not this a preparation for life? and isnot life itself made up of certain other things than this? This is just as ifan athlete should weep when he enters the stadium, because he is not beingexercised outside of it. It was for this purpose that you used to practiceexercise; for this purpose were used the halteres, the dust, the young men asantagonists; and do you seek for those things now when it is the time ofaction? This is just as if in the topic of assent when appearances presentthemselves, some of which can he comprehended, and some cannot be comprehended,we should not choose to distinguish them but should choose to read what hasbeen written about comprehension.    What then is the reason of this? The reason is that we have never read forthis purpose, we have never written for this purpose, so that we may in ouractions use in a way conformable to nature the appearances presented to us; butwe terminate in this, in learning what is said, and in being able to expound itto another, in resolving a syllogism, and in handling the hypotheticalsyllogism. For this reason where our study is, there alone is the impediment.Would you have by all means the things which are not in your power? Beprevented then, be hindered, fail in your purpose. But if we read what iswritten about action, not that we may see what is said about action, but thatwe may act well: if we read what is said about desire and aversion, in orderthat we may neither fall in our desires, nor fall into that which we try toavoid: if we read what is said about duty, in order that, remembering therelations, we may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these relations; weshould not be vexed in being hindered as to our readings, but we should besatisfied with doing, the acts which are conformable, and we should bereckoning not what so far we have been accustomed to reckon; "To-day I haveread so many verses, I have written so many"; but, "To-day I have employed myaction as it is taught by the philosophers; I have not employed any desire; Ihave used avoidance only with respect to things which are within the power ofmy will; I have not been afraid of such a person, I have not been prevailedupon by the entreaties of another; I have exercised my patience, my abstinencemy co-operation with others"; and so we should thank God for what we ought tothank Him.    But now we do not know that we also in another way are like the many.Another man is afraid that he shall not have power: you are afraid that youwill. Do not do so, my man; but as you ridicule him who is afraid that he,shall not have power, so ridicule yourself also. For it makes no differencewhether you are thirsty like a man who has a fever, or have a dread of waterlike a man who is mad. Or how will you still be able to say as Socrates did,"If so it pleases God, so let it be"? Do you think that Socrates, if he hadbeen eager to pass his leisure in the Lyceum or in the Academy and to discoursedally with the young men, would have readily served in military expeditions sooften as he did; and would he not have lamented and groaned, "Wretch that I am;I must now be miserable here, when I might be sunning myself in the Lyceum"?Why, was this your business, to sun yourself? And is it not your business to behappy, to be free from hindrance, free from impediment? And could he still havebeen Socrates, if he had lamented in this way: how would he still have beenable to write Paeans in his prison?    In short, remember this, that what you shall prize which is beyond yourwill, so far you have destroyed your will. But these things are out of thepower of the will, not only power, but also a private condition: not onlyoccupation, but also leisure. "Now, then, must I live in this tumult?" Why doyou say "tumult"? "I mean among many men." Well what is the hardship? Supposethat you are at Olympia: imagine it to be a panegyris, where one is calling outone thing, another is doing another thing, and a third is pushing anotherperson: in the baths there is a crowd: and who of us is not pleased with thisassembly and leaves it unwillingly, Be not difficult to please nor fastidiousabout what happens. "Vinegar is disagreeable, for it is sharp; honey isdisagreeable, for it disturbs my habit of body. I do not like vegetables." Soalso, "I do not like leisure; it is a desert: I do not like a crowd; it isconfusion." But if circumstances make it necessary for you to live alone orwith a few, call it quiet and use the thing as you ought: talk with yourself,exercise the appearances, work up your preconceptions. If you fall into acrowd, call it a celebration of games, a panegyris, a festival: try to enjoythe festival with other men. For what is a more pleasant sight to him who lovesmankind than a number of men? We see with pleasure herds of horses or oxen: weare delighted when we see many ships: who is pained when he sees many men? "Butthey deafen me with their cries." Then your hearing is impeded. What, then, isthis to you? Is, then, the power of making use of appearances hindered? And whoprevents you from using, according to nature, inclination to a thing andaversion from it; and movement toward a thing and movement from it? What tumultis able to do this?    Do you only bear in mind the general rules: "What is mine, what is notmine; what is given to me; what does God will that I should do now? what doesHe not will?" A little before he willed you to be at leisure, to talk withyourself, to write about these things, to read, to hear, to prepare yourself.You had sufficient time for this. Now He says to you: "Come now to the contest;show us what you have learned, how you have practiced the athletic art. Howlong will you be exercised alone? Now is the opportunity for you to learnwhether you are an athlete worthy of victory, or one of those who go about theworld and are defeated." Why, then, are; you vexed? No contest is withoutconfusion. There be many who exercise themselves for the contests, many whocall out to those who exercise themselves, many masters, many spectators. "Butmy wish is to live quietly." Lament, then, and groan as you deserve to do. Forwhat other is a greater punishment than this to the untaught man and to him whodisobeys the divine commands: to be grieved, to lament, to envy, in a word, tobe disappointed and to he unhappy? Would you not release yourself from thesethings? "And how shall I release myself?" Have you not often heard that youought to remove entirely desire, apply aversion to those things only which arewithin your power, that you ought to give up everything, body, property, fame,books, tumult, power, private station? for whatever way you turn, you are aslave, you are subjected, you are hindered, you are compelled, you are entirelyin the power of others. But keep the words of Cleanthes in readiness,       Lead me, O Zeus, and thou necessity.    Is it your will that I should go to Rome? I will go to Rome. To Gyara? Iwill go to Gyara. I will go to Athens? I will go to Athens. To prison? I willgo to prison. If you should once say, "When shall a man go to Athens?" you areundone. It is a necessary consequence that this desire, if it is notaccomplished, must make you unhappy; and if it is accomplished, it must makeyou vain, since you are elated at things at which you ought not to be elated;and on the other hand, if you are impeded, it must make you wretched becauseyou fall into that which you would not fall into. Give up then all thesethings. "Athens is a good place." But happiness is much better; and to be freefrom passions, free from disturbance, for your affairs not to depend on anyman. "There is tumult at Rome and visits of salutation." But happiness is anequivalent for all troublesome things. If, then, the time comes for thesethings, why do you not take away the wish to avoid them? what necessity isthere to carry to avoid a burden like an ass, and to be beaten with a stick?But if you do not so, consider that you must always be a slave to him who hasit in his power to effect your release, and also to impede you, and you mustserve him as an evil genius.    There is only one way to happiness, and let this rule be ready both in themorning and during the day and by night; the rule is not to look toward thingswhich are out of the power of our will, to think that nothing is our own, togive up all things to the Divinity, to Fortune; to make them thesuperintendents of these things, whom Zeus also has made so; for a man toobserve that only which is his own, that which cannot be hindered; and when weread, to refer our reading to this only, and our writing and our listening. Forthis reason, I cannot call the man industrious, if I hear this only, that hereads and writes; and even if a man adds that he reads all night, I cannot sayso, if he knows not to what he should refer his reading. For neither do you saythat a man is industrious if he keeps awake for a girl; nor do I. But if hedoes it for reputation, I say that he is a lover of reputation. And if he doesit for money, I say that he is a lover of money, not a lover of labour; and ifhe does it through love of learning, I say that he is a lover of learning. Butif he refers his labour to his own ruling power, that he may keep it in a stateconformable to nature and pass his life in that state, then only do I say thathe is industrious. For never commend a man on account of these things which arecommon to all, but on account of his opinions; for these are the things whichbelong to each man, which make his actions bad or good. Remembering theserules, rejoice in that which is present, and be content with the things whichcome in season. If you see anything which you have learned and inquired aboutoccurring, to you in your course of life, be delighted at it. If you have laidaside or have lessened bad disposition and a habit of reviling; if you havedone so with rash temper, obscene words, hastiness, sluggishness; if you arenot moved by what you formerly were, and not in the same way as you once were,you can celebrate a festival daily, to-day because you have behaved well in oneact, and to-morrow because you have behaved well in another. How much greateris this a reason for making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of aprovince? These things come to you from yourself and from the gods. Rememberthis, Who gives these things and to whom, and for what purpose. If you cherishyourself in these thoughts, do you still think that it makes any differencewhere yon shall be happy, where you shall please God? Are not the gods equallydistant from all places? Do they not see from all places alike that which isgoing on?

</p>

<p>
Against the quarrelsome and ferocious
</p>

<p>
    The wise and good man neither himself fights with any person, nor does heallow another, so far as he can prevent it. And an example of this as well asof all other things is proposed to us in the life of Socrates, who not onlyhimself on all occasions avoided fights, but would not allow even others toquarrel. See in Xenophon's Symposium how many quarrels he settled; how furtherhe endured Thrasymachus and Polus and Callicles; how he tolerated his wife, andhow he tolerated his son who attempted to confute him aid to cavil with him.For he remembered well that no man has in his power another man's rulingprinciple. He wished, therefore nothing else than that which was his own. Andwhat is this? Not that this or that man may act according to nature; for thatis a thing which belongs to another; but that while others are doing their ownacts, as they choose, he may never the less be in a condition conformable tonature and live in it, only doing what is his own to the end that others alsomay be in a state conformable to nature. For this is the object always setbefore him by the wise and good man. Is it to be commander of an army? No: butif it is permitted him, his object is in this matter to maintain his own rulingprinciple. Is it to marry? No; but if marriage is allowed to him, in thismatter his object is to maintain himself in a condition conformable to nature.But if he would have his son not to do wrong, or his wife, he would have whatbelongs to another not to belong to another; and to he instructed is this: tolearn what things are a man's own and what belongs to another.    How, then, is there left any place for fighting, to a man who has thisopinion? Is he surprised at anything which happens, and does it appear new tohim? Does he not expect that which comes from the bad to be worse and moregrievous than what actually befalls him? And does he not reckon as pure gainwhatever they may do which falls short of extreme wickedness? "Such a personhas reviled you." Great thanks to him for not having, struck you. "But he hasstruck me also." Great thanks that he did not wound you "But he wounded mealso." Great thanks that he did not kill you. For when did he learn or in whatschool that man is a tame animal, that men love one another, that an act ofinjustice is a great harm to him who does it. Since then he has not to him whodoes it. Since then he has not learned this and is not convinced of it, whyshall he not follow that which seems to be for his own "Your neighbour hasthrown stones." Have you then done anything wrong? "But the things in the househave been broken." Are you then a utensil? No; but a free power of will. What,then, is given to you in answer to this? If you are like a wolf, you must bitein return, and throw more stones. But if you consider what is proper for a man,examine your store-house, see with at faculties you came into the world. Haveyou the disposition of a wild beast, Have you the disposition of revenge for aninjury? When is a horse wretched? When he is deprived of his natural faculties;not when he cannot crow like a cock, but when he cannot run. When is a dogwretched? Not when he cannot fly, but when he cannot track his game. Is, then,a man also unhappy in this way, not because he cannot strangle lions or embracestatues, for he did not come into the world in the possession of certain powersfrom nature for this purpose, but because he has lost his probity and hisfidelity? People ought to meet and lament such a man for the misfortunes intowhich he has fallen; not indeed to lament because a man his been born or hasdied, but because it has happened to him in his lifetime to have lost thethings which are his own, not that which he received from his father, not hisland and house, and his inn, and his slaves; for not one of these things is aman's own, but all belong to others, are servile and subject to account, atdifferent times given to different persons by those who have them in theirpower: but I mean the things which belong to him as a man, the marks in hismind with which he came into the world, such as we seek also on coins, and ifwe find them, we approve of the coins, and if we do not find the marks, wereject them. What is the stamp on this Sestertius? "The stamp of Trajan."Present it. "It is the stamp of Nero." Throw it away: it cannot be accepted, itis counterfeit. So also in this case. What is the stamp of his opinions? "It isgentleness, a sociable disposition, a tolerant temper, a disposition to mutualaffection." Produce these qualities. I accept them: I consider this man acitizen, I accept him as a neighbour, a companion in my voyages. Only see thathe has not Nero's stamp. Is he passionate, is he full of resentment, is hefaultfinding? If the whim seizes him, does he break the heads of those who comein his way? Why, then did you say that he is a man? Is everything judged by thebare form? If that is so, say that the form in wax is all apple and has thesmell and the taste of an apple. But the external figure is not enough: neitherthen is the nose enough and the eyes to make the man, but he must have theopinions of a man. Here is a man who does not listen to reason, who does notknow when he is refuted: he is an ass: in another man the sense of shame isbecome dead: he is good for nothing, he is anything rather than a man. This manseeks whom he may meet and kick or bite, so that he is not even a sheep or anass, but a kind of wild beast.    "What then would you have me to be despised?" By whom? by those who knowyou? and how and how shall those who know you despise a man who is gentle andmodest? Perhaps you mean by those who do not know you? What is that to you? Forno other artisan cares for the opinion of those who know not his art. "But theywill be more hostile to me for this reason." Why do you say "me"? Can any maninjure your will, or prevent you from using in a natural way the appearanceswhich are presented to you, "In no way can he." Why, then, are still disturbedand why do you choose to show yourself afraid? And why do you not come forthand proclaim that you are at peace with all men whatever they may do, and laughat those chiefly who think that they can harm you? "These slaves," you can say,"know not either who I am nor where lies my good or my evil, because they haveno access to the things which are mine."    In this way, also, those who occupy a strong city mock the besiegers; "Whattrouble these men are now taking for nothing: our wall is secure, we have foodfor a very long time, and all other resources." These are the things which makea city strong and impregnable: but nothing else than his opinions makes a man'ssoul impregnable. For what wall is so strong, or what body is so hard, or whatpossession is so safe, or what honour so free from assault? All thingseverywhere are perishable, easily taken by assault, and, if any man in any wayis attached to them, he must be disturbed, expect what is bad, he must fear,lament, find his desires disappointed, and fall into things which he wouldavoid. Then do we not choose to make secure the only means of safety which areoffered to us, and do we not choose to withdraw ourselves from that which isperishable and servile and to labour at the things, which are imperishable andby nature free; and do we not remember that no man either hurts another or doesgood to another, but that a man's opinion about each thing is that which hurtshim, is that which overturns him; this is fighting, this is civil discord, thisis war? That which made Eteocles and Polynices enemies was nothing else thanthis opinion which they had about royal power, their opinion about exile, thatthe one is the extreme of evils, the other the greatest good. Now this is thenature of every man to seek the good, to avoid the bad; to consider him whodeprives us of the one and involves us in the other an enemy and treacherous,even if he be a brother, or a son or a father. For nothing is more akin to usthan the good: therefore if these things are good and evil, neither is a fathera friend to sons, nor a brother to a brother, but all the world is everywherefull of enemies, treacherous men, and sycophants. But if the will, being whatit ought to be, is the only good; and if the will, being such as it ought notto be, is the only evil, where is there any strife, where is there reviling?about what? about the things which do not concern us? and strife with whom?with the ignorant, the unhappy, with those who are deceived about the chiefthings?    Remembering this Socrates managed his own house and endured a veryill-tempered wife and a foolish son. For in what did she show her bad temper?In pouring water on his head as much as she liked, and in trampling on thecake. And what is this to me, if I think that these things are nothing to me?But this is my business; and neither tyrant shall check my will nor a master;nor shall the many check me who am only one, nor shall the stronger check mewho am the weaker; for this power of being free from check is given by God toevery man. For these opinions make love in a house, concord in a state, amongnations peace, and gratitude to God; they make a man in all things cheerful inexternals as about things which belong to others, as about things which are ofno value. We indeed are able to write and to read these things, and to praisethem when they are read, but we do not even come near to being convinced ofthem. Therefore what is said of the Lacedaemonians, "Lions at home, but inEphesus foxes," will fit in our case also, "Lions in the school, but out of itfoxes."

Chapter 6
</p>

<p>
Against those who lament over being pitied
</p>

<p>
    "I am grieved," a man says, "at being pitied." Whether, then, is the factof your being pitied a thing which concerns you or those who pity you? Well, isit in your power to stop this pity? "It is in my power, if I show them that Ido not require pity." And whether, then, are you in the condition of notdeserving pity, or are you not in that condition? "I think I am not: but thesepersons do not pity me for the things for which, if they ought to pity me, itwould be proper, I mean, for my faults; but they pity me for my poverty, fornot possessing honourable offices, for diseases and deaths and other suchthings." Whether, then, are you prepared to convince the many that not one ofthese things is an evil, but that it is possible for a man who is poor and hasno office and enjoys no honour to be happy; or to show yourself to them as richand in power? For the second of these things belong, to a man who is boastful,silly and good for nothing. And consider by what means the pretense must besupported. It will be necessary for you to hire slaves and to possess a fewsilver vessels, and to exhibit them in public, if it is possible, though theyare often the same, and to attempt to conceal the fact that they are the same,and to have splendid garments, and all other things for display, and to showthat you are a man honoured by the great, and to try to sup at their houses, orto be supposed to sup there, and as to your person to employ some mean arts,that you may appear to be more handsome and nobler than you are. These thingsyou must contrive, if you choose to go by the second path in order not to bepitied. But the first way is both impracticable and long, to attempt the verything which Zeus has not been able to do, to convince all men what things aregood and bad. Is this power given to you? This only is given to you, toconvince yourself; and you have not convinced yourself. Then I ask you, do youattempt to persuade other men? and who has lived so long with you as you withyourself? and who has so much power of convincing you as you have of convincingyourself; and who is better disposed and nearer to you than you are toyourself? How, then, have you not convinced yourself in order to learn? Atpresent are not things upside down? Is this what you have been earnest aboutdoing, to learn to be free from grief and free from disturbance, and not to behumbled, and to be free? Have you not heard, then, that there is only one waywhich leads to this end, to give up the things which do not depend on the will,to withdraw from them, and to admit that they belong to others? For anotherman, then, to have an opinion about you, of what kind is it? "It is a thingindependent of the will." Then is it nothing to you? "It is nothing." When,then, you are still vexed at this and disturbed, do you think that you areconvinced about good and evil?    Will you not, then, letting others alone, be to yourself both scholar andteacher? "The rest of mankind will look after this, whether it is to theirinterest to be and to pass their lives in a state contrary to nature: but to meno man is nearer than myself. What, then, is the meaning of this, that I havelistened to the words of the philosophers and I assent to them, but in fact Iam no way made easier? Am I so stupid? And yet, in all other things such as Ihave chosen, I have not been found very stupid; but I learned letters quickly,and to wrestle, and geometry, and to resolve syllogisms. Has not, then, reasonconvinced me? and indeed no other things have I from the beginning so approvedand chosen: and now I read about these things, hear about them, write aboutthem; I have so far discovered no reason stronger than this. In what, then, amI deficient? Have the contrary opinions not been eradicated from me? Have thenotions themselves not been exercised nor used to be applied to action, but asarmour are laid aside and rusted and cannot fit me? And yet neither in theexercises of the palaestra, nor in writing or reading am I satisfied withlearning, but I turn up and down the syllogisms which are proposed, and I makeothers, and sophistical syllogisms also. But the necessary theorems, byproceeding from which a man can become free from grief, fear, passions,hindrance, and a free man, these I do not exercise myself in nor do I practicein these the proper practice. Then I care about what others will say of me,whether I shall appear to them worth notice, whether I shall appear happy."    Wretched man, will you not see what you. are saying about yourself? What doyou appear to yourself to be? in your opinions, in your desires, in youraversions from things, in your movements, in your preparation, in your designs,and in other acts suitable to a man? But do you trouble yourself about this,whether others pity you? "Yes, but I am pitied not as I ought to be." Are youthen pained at this? and is he who is pained, an object of pity? "Yes." How,then, are you pitied not as you ought to be? For by the very act that you feelabout being pitied, you make yourself deserving of pity. What then saysAntisthenes? Have you not heard? "It is a royal thing, O Cyrus, to do right andto be ill-spoken of." My head is sound, and all think that I have the headache.What do I care for that? I am free from fever, and people sympathize with me asif I had a fever: "Poor man, for so long a time you have not ceased to havefever." I also say with a sorrowful countenance: "In truth it is now a longtime that I have been ill." "What will happen then?" "As God may please": andat the same time I secretly laugh at those who are pitying me. What, then,hinders the same being done in this case also? I am poor, but I have a rightopinion about poverty. Why, then, do I care if they pity me for my poverty? Iam not in power; but others are: and I have the opinion which I ought to haveabout having and not having power. Let them look to it who pity me; but I amneither hungry nor thirsty nor do I suffer cold; but because they are hungry orthirsty they think that I too am. What, then, shall I do for them? Shall I goabout and proclaim and say: "Be not mistaken, men, I am very well, I do nottrouble myself about poverty, nor want of power, nor in a word about anythingelse than right opinions. These I have free from restraint, I care for nothingat all." What foolish talk is this? How do I possess right opinions when I amnot content with being what I am, but am uneasy about what I am supposed to be?    "But," you say, "others will get more and be preferred to me." What, then,is more reasonable than for those who have laboured about anything to have morein that thing in which they have laboured? They have laboured for power, youhave laboured about opinions; and they have laboured for wealth, you for theproper use of appearances. See if they have more than you in this about whichyou have laboured, and which they neglect; if they assent better than you withrespect to the natural rules of things; if they are less disappointed than youin their desires; if they fall less into things which they would avoid than youdo; if in their intentions, if in the things which they propose to themselves,if in their purposes, if in their motions toward an object they take a betteraim; if they better observe a proper behavior, as men, as sons, as parents, andso on as to the other names by which we express the relations of life. But ifthey exercise power, and you do not, will you not choose to tell yourself thetruth, that you do nothing for the sake of this, and they do all? But it ismost unreasonable that he who looks after anything should obtain less than hewho does not look after it.    "Not so: but since I care about right opinions, it more reasonable for meto have power." Yes in the matter about which you do care, in opinions. But ina matter in which they have cared more than you, give way to them. The case isjust the same as if, because you have right opinions, you thought that in usingthe bow you should hit the mark better than an archer, and in working in metalyou should succeed better than a smith. Give up, then, your earnestness aboutopinions and employ yourself about the things which you wish to acquire; andthen lament, if you do not succeed; for you deserve to lament. But now you saythat you are occupied with other things, that you are looking after otherthings; but the many say this truly, that one act has no community withanother. He who has risen in the morning seeks whom he shall salute, to whom heshall say something agreeable, to whom he shall send a present, how he shallplease the dancing man, how by bad behavior to one he may please another. Whenhe prays, he prays about these things; when he sacrifices, he sacrifices forthese things: the saying of Pythagoras       Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyeshe transfers to these things. "Where have I failed in the matters pertaining toflattery?" "What have I done?" Anything like a free man, anything like anoble-minded man? And if he finds anything of the kind, he blames and accuseshimself: "Why did you say this? Was it not in your power to lie? Even thephilosophers say that nothing hinders us from telling a lie." But do you, ifindeed you have cared about nothing else except the proper use of appearances,as soon as you have risen in the morning reflect, "What do I want in order tobe free from passion, and free from perturbation? What am I? Am I a poor body,a piece of property, a thing of which something is said? I am none of these.But what am I? I am a rational animal. What then is required of me?" Reflect onyour acts. "Where have I omitted the things which conduce to happiness? Whathave I done which is either unfriendly or unsocial? what have I not done as tothese things which I ought to have done?"    So great, then, being, the difference in desires, actions, wishes, wouldyou still have the same share with others in those things about which you havenot laboured, and they have laboured? Then are you surprised if they pity you,and are you vexed? But they are not vexed if you pity them. Why? Because theyare convinced that they have that which is good, and you are not convinced. Forthis reason you are not satisfied with your own, but you desire that which theyhave: but they are satisfied with their own, and do not desire what you have:since, if you were really convinced that with respect to what is good, it isyou who are the possessor of it and that they have missed it, you would noteven have thought of what they say about you.

Chapter 7
</p>

<p>
On freedom from fear
</p>

<p>
    What makes the tyrant formidable? "The guards," you say, "and their swords,and the men of the bedchamber and those who exclude them who would enter." Why,then, if you bring a boy to the tyrant when he is with his guards, is he notafraid; or is it because the child does not understand these things? If, then,any man does understand what guards are and that they have swords, and comes tothe tyrant for this very purpose because he wishes to die on account of somecircumstance and seeks to die easily by the hand of another, is he afraid ofthe guards? "No, for he wishes for the thing which makes the guardsformidable." If, then, neither any man wishing to die nor to live by all means,but only as it may be permitted, approaches the tyrant, what hinders him fromapproaching the tyrant without fear? "Nothing." If, then, a man has the sameopinion about his property as the man whom I have instanced has about his body;and also about his children and his wife, and in a word is so affected by somemadness or despair that he cares not whether he possesses them or not, but likechildren who are playing, with shells care about the play, but do not troublethemselves about the shells, so he too has set no value on the materials, butvalues the pleasure that he has with them and the occupation, what tyrant isthen formidable to him or what guards or what swords?    Then through madness is it possible for a man to be so disposed towardthese things, and the Galilaens through habit, and is it possible that no mancan learn from reason and from demonstration that God has made all the thingsin the universe and the universe itself completely free from hindrance andperfect, and the parts of it for the use of the whole? All other animals indeedare incapable of comprehending the administration of it; but the rationalanimal, man, has faculties for the consideration of all these and forunderstanding that it is a part, and what kind of a part it is, and that it isright for the parts to be subordinate to the whole. And besides this beingnaturally noble, magnanimous and free, man sees that of the things whichsurround him some are free from hindrance and in his power, and the otherthings are subject to hindrance and in the power of others; that the thingswhich are free from hindrance are in the power of the will; and those which aresubject to hinderance are the things which are not in the power of the will.And, for this reason, if he thinks that his good and his interest be in thesethings only which are free from hindrance and in his own power, he will befree, prosperous, happy, free from harm, magnanimous pious, thankful to God forall things; in no matter finding fault with any of the things which have notbeen put in his power, nor blaming any of them. But if he thinks that his goodand his interest are in externals and in things which are not in the power ofhis will, he must of necessity be hindered, be impeded, be a slave to those whohave the power over things which he admires and fears; and he must of necessitybe impious because he thinks that he is harmed by God, and he must be unjustbecause he always claims more than belongs to him; and he must of necessity beabject and mean.    What hinders a man, who has clearly separated these things, from livingwith a light heart and bearing easily the reins, quietly expecting everythingwhich can happen, and enduring that which has already happened? "Would you haveme to bear poverty?" Come and you will know what poverty is when it has foundone who can act well the part of a poor man. "Would you have me to possesspower?" Let me have power, and also the trouble of it. "Well, banishment?"Wherever I shall go, there it will be well with me; for here also where I am,it was not because of the place that it was well with me, but because of myopinions which I shall carry off with me: for neither can any man deprive me ofthem; but my opinions alone are mine and they cannot he taken from me, and I amsatisfied while I have them, wherever I may be and whatever I am doing. "Butnow it is time to die." Why do you say "to die"? Make no tragedy show of thething, but speak of it as it is: it is now time for the matter to be resolvedinto the things out of which it was composed. And what is the formidable thinghere? what is going to perish of the things which are in the universe? what newthing or wondrous is going to happen? Is it for this reason that a tyrant isformidable? Is it for this reason that the guards appear to have swords whichare large and sharp? Say this to others; but I have considered about all thesethins; no man has power over me. I have been made free; I know His commands, noman can now lead me as a slave. I have a proper person to assert my freedom; Ihave proper judges. Are you not the master of my body? What, then, is that tome? Are you not the master of my property? What, then, is that to me? Are younot the master of my exile or of my chains? Well, from all these things and allthe poor body itself I depart at your bidding, when you please. Make trial ofyour power, and you will know how far it reaches.    Whom then can I still fear? Those who are over the bedchamber? Lest theyshould do, what? Shut me out? If they find that I wish to enter, let them shutme out. "Why, then, do you go to the doors?" Because I think it befits me,while the play lasts, to join in it. "How, then, are you not shut out?"Because, unless some one allows me to go in, I do not choose to ,o in, but amalways content with that I which happens; for I think that what God chooses isbetter than what I choose. I will attach myself as a minister and follower toHim; I have the same movements as He has, I have the same desires; in a word, Ihave the same will. There is no shutting out for me, but for those who wouldforce their in. Why, then, do not I force my way in? Because I know thatnothing good is distributed within to those who enter. But when I hear any mancalled fortunate because he is honoured by Caesar, I say, "What does he happento get?" A province. Does he also obtain an opinion such as he ought? Theoffice of a Prefect. Does he also obtain the power of using his office well?Why do I still strive to enter? A man scatters dried figs and nuts: thechildren seize them and fight with one another; men do not, for they think themto be a small matter. But if a man should throw about shells, even the childrendo not seize them. Provinces are distributed: let children look to that. Moneyis distributed: let children look to that. Praetorships, consulships aredistributed: let children scramble for them, let them be shut out, beaten, kissthe hands of the giver, of the slaves: but to me these are only dried figs andnuts. What then? If you fail to get them, while Caesar is scattering themabout, do not be troubled: if a dried fig come into your lap, take it and eatit; for so far you may value even a fig. But if I shall stoop down and turnanother over, or be turned over by another, and shall flatter those who havegot into chamber, neither is a dried fig worth the trouble, nor anything elseof the things which are not good, which the philosophers have persuaded me notto think good.    Show me the swords of the guards. "See how big they are, and how sharp."What, then, do these big and sharp swords do? "They kill." And what does afever do? "Nothing else." And what else a tile? "Nothing else." Would you thenhave me to wonder at these things and worship them, and go about as the slaveof all of them? I hope that this will not happen: but when I have once learnedthat everything which has come into existence must also go out of it, that theuniverse may not stand still nor be impeded, I no longer consider it anydifference whether a fever shall do it, or a tile, or a soldier. But if a manmust make a comparison between these things, I know that the soldier will do itwith less trouble, and quicker. When, then, I neither fear anything which atyrant can do to me, nor desire anything which he can give, why do I still lookon with wonder? Why am I still confounded? Why do I fear the guards? Why am Ipleased if he speaks to me in a friendly way, and receives me, and why do Itell others how he spoke to me? Is he a Socrates, is he a Diogenes that hispraise should be a proof of what I am? Have I been eager to imitate his morals?But I keep up the play and go to him, and serve him so long as he does not bidme to do anything foolish or unreasonable. But if he says to me, "Go and bringLeon of Salamis," I say to him, "Seek another, for I am no longer playing.""Lead him away." I follow; that is part of the play. "But your head will betaken off." Does the tyrant's head always remain where it is, and the heads ofyou who obey him? "But you will be cast out unburied." If the corpse is I, Ishall be cast out; but if I am different from the corpse, speak more properlyaccording as the fact is, and do not think of frightening me. These things areformidable to children and fools. But if any man has once entered aphilosopher's school and knows not what he is, he deserves to be full of fearand to flatter those whom afterward he used to flatter; if he has not yetlearned that he is not flesh nor bones nor sinews, but he is that which makesuse of these parts of the body and governs them and follows the appearances ofthings.    "Yes, but this talk makes us despise the laws." And what kind of talk makesmen more obedient to the laws who employ such talk? And the things which are inthe power of a fool are not law. And yet see how this talk makes us disposed aswe ought to be even to these men; since it teaches us to claim in opposition tothem none of the things in which they are able to surpass us. This talk teachesus, as to the body, to give it up, as to property, to give that up also, as tochildren, parents, brothers, to retire from these, to give up all; It onlymakes an exception of the opinions, which even Zeus has willed to be the selectproperty of every man. What transgression of the laws is there here, whatfolly? Where you are superior and stronger, there I give way to you: on theother hand, where I am superior, do you yield to me; for I have studied this,and you have not. It is your study to live in houses with floors formed ofvarious stones, how your slaves and dependents shall serve you, how you shallwear fine clothing, have many hunting men, lute players, and tragic actors. DoI claim any of these? have you made any study of opinions and of your ownrational faculty? Do you know of what parts it is composed, how they arebrought together, how they are connected, what powers it has, and of what kind?Why then are you vexed, if another, who has made it his study, has theadvantage over you in these things? "But these things are the greatest." Andwho hinders you from being employed about these things and looking after them?And who has a better stock of books, of leisure, of persons to aid you? Onlyturn your mind at last to these things, attend, if it be only a short time, toyour own ruling faculty: consider what this is that you possess, and whence itcame, this which uses all others, and tries them, and selects and rejects. Butso long as you employ yourself about externals you will possess them as no manelse does; but you will have this such as you choose to have it, sordid andneglected.

Against those who hastily rush into the use of the philosophic dress
</p>

<p>
    Never praise nor blame a man because of the things which are common, and donot ascribe to him any skill or want of skill; and thus you will be free fromrashness and from malevolence. "This man bathes very quickly." Does he then dowrong? Certainly not. But what does he do? He bathes very quickly. Are allthings then done well? By no means: but the acts which proceed from rightopinions are done well; and those which proceed from bad opinions are done ill.But do you, until you know the opinion from which a man does each thing,neither praise nor blame the act. But the opinion is not easily discovered fromthe external things. "This man is a carpenter." Why? "Because he uses an ax."What, then, is this to the matter? "This man is a musician because he sings."And what does that signify? "This man is a philosopher. Because he wears acloak and long hair." And what does a juggler wear? For this reason if a mansees any philosopher acting indecently, immediately he says, "See what thephilosopher is doing"; but he ought because of the man's indecent behaviorrather to say that he is not a philosopher. For if this is the preconceivednotion of a philosopher and what he professes, to wear a cloak and long hair,men would say well; but if what he professes is this rather, to keep himselffree from faults, why do we not rather, because he does not make good hisprofessions, take from him the name of philosopher? For so we do in the case ofall other arts. When a man sees another handling an ax badly, he does not say,"What is the use of the carpenter's art? See how badly carpenters do theirwork"; but he says just the contrary, "This man is not a carpenter, for he usesan ax badly." In the same way if a man hears another singing badly, he does notsay, "See how musicians sing"; but rather, "This man is not a musician." But itis in the matter of philosophy only that people do this. When they see a manacting contrary to the profession of a philosopher, they do not take away histitle, but they assume him to be a philosopher, and from his acts deriving thefact that he is behaving indecently they conclude that there is no use inphilosophy.    What, then, is the reason of this? Because we attach value to the notion ofa carpenter, and to that of a musician, and to the notion of other artisans inlike manner, but not to that of a philosopher, and we judge from externals onlythat it is a thing confused and ill defined. And what other kind of art has aname from the dress and the hair; and has not theorems and a material and anend? What, then, is the material of the philosopher? Is it a cloak? No, butreason. What is his end? is it to wear a cloak? No, but to possess the reasonin a right state. Of what kind are his theorems? Are they those about the wayin which the beard becomes great or the hair long? No, but rather what Zenosays, to know the elements of reason, what kind of a thing each of them is, andhow they are fitted to one another, and what things are consequent upon them.Will you not, then, see first if he does what he professes when he acts in anunbecoming manner, and then blame his study? But now when you yourself areacting in a sober way, you say in consequence of what he seems to you to bedoing wrong, "Look at the philosopher," as if it were proper to call by thename of philosopher one who does these things; and further, "This is theconduct of a philosopher." But you do not say, "Look at the carpenter," whenyou know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you see him to be a glutton; nordo you say, "See the musician." Thus to a certain degree even you perceive theprofession of a philosopher, but you fall away from the notion, and you areconfused through want of care.    But even the philosophers themselves as they are called pursue the thing bybeginning with things which are common to them and others: as soon as they haveassumed a cloak and grown a beard, they say, "I am a philosopher." But no manwill say, "I am a musician," if he has bought a plectrum and a lute: nor willhe say, "I am a smith," if he has put on a cap and apron. But the dress isfitted to the art; and they take their name from the art, and not from thedress. For this reason Euphrates used to say well, "A long time I strove to bea philosopher without people knowing it; and this," he said, "was useful to me:for first I knew that when I did anything well, I did not do it for the sake ofthe spectators, but for the sake of myself: I ate well for the sake of myself;I had my countenance well composed and my walk: all for myself and for God.Then, as I struggled alone, so I alone also was in danger: in no respectthrough me, if I did anything base or unbecoming, was philosophy endangered;nor did I injure the many by doing anything wrong as a philosopher. For thisreason those who did not know my purpose used to wonder how it was that, whileI conversed and lived altogether with all philosophers, I was not a philosophermyself. And what was the harm for me to be known to be a philosopher by my actsand not by outward marks?" See how I eat, how I drink, how I sleep, how I bearand forbear, how I co-operate, how I employ desire, how I employ aversion, howI maintain the relations, those which are natural or those which are acquired,how free from confusion, how free from hindrance. Judge of me from this, if youcan. But if you are so deaf and blind that you cannot conceive even Hephaestusto be a good smith, unless you see the cap on his head, what is the harm in notbeing recognized by so foolish a judge?    So Socrates was not known to be a philosopher by most persons; and theyused to come to him and ask to be introduced to philosophers. Was he vexed thenas we are, and did he say, "And do you not think that I am a philosopher?" No,but he would take them and introduce them, being satisfied with one thing, withbeing a philosopher; and being pleased also with not being thought to be aphilosopher, he was not annoyed: for he thought of his own occupation. What isthe work of an honourable and good man? To have many pupils? By no means. Theywill look to this matter who are earnest about it. But was it his business toexamine carefully difficult theorems? Others will look after these mattersalso. In what, then, was he, and who was he and whom did he wish to be? He wasin that wherein there was hurt and advantage. "If any man can damage me," hesays, "I am doing nothing: if I am waiting for another man to do me good, I amnothing. If I anguish for anything, and it does not happen, I am unfortunate."To such a contest he invited every man, and I do not think that he would havedeclined the contest with any one. What do you suppose? was it by proclaimingand saying, "I am such a man?" Far from it, but by being such a man. Forfurther, this is the character of a fool and a boaster to say, "I am free frompassions and disturbance: do not be ignorant, my friends, that while you areuneasy and disturbed about things of no value, I alone am free from allperturbation." So is it not enough for you to feel no pain, unless you makethis proclamation: "Come together all who are suffering gout, pains in thehead, fever, ye who are lame, blind, and observe that I am sound from everyailment." This is empty and disagreeable to hear, unless like Aesculapius youare able to show immediately by what kind of treatment they also shall beimmediately free from disease, and unless you show your own health as anexample.    For such is the Cynic who is honoured with the sceptre and the diadem ofZeus, and says, "That you may see, O men, that you seek happiness andtranquillity not where it is, but where it is not, behold I am sent to you byGod as an example. I who have neither property nor house, nor wife norchildren, nor even a bed, nor coat nor household utensil; and see how healthy Iam: try me, and if you see that I am free from perturbations, hear the remediesand how I have been cured." This is both philanthropic and noble. But see whosework it is, the work of Zeus, or of him whom He may judge worthy of thisservice, that he may never exhibit anything to the many, by which he shall makeof no effect his own testimony, whereby he gives testimony to virtue, and bearsevidence against external things:       His beauteous face pales his cheeks       He wipes a tear.    And not this only, but he neither desires nor seeks anything, nor man norplace nor amusement, as children seek the vintage or holidays; always fortifiedby modesty as others are fortified by walls and doors and doorkeepers.    But now, being only moved to philosophy, as those who have a bad stomachare moved to some kinds of food which they soon loathe, straightway toward thesceptre and to the royal power. They let the hair grow, they assume the cloak,they show the shoulder bare, they quarrel with those whom they meet; and ifthey see a man in a thick winter coat, they quarrel with him. Man, firstexercise yourself in winter weather: see your movements that they are not thoseof a man with a bad stomach or those of a longing woman. First strive that itbe not known what you are: be a philosopher to yourself a short time. Fruitgrows thus: the seed must be buried for some time, hid, grow slowly in orderthat it may come to perfection. But if it produces the ear before the jointedstem, it is imperfect, a produce of the garden of Adonis. Such a poor plant areyou also: you have blossomed too soon; the cold weather will scorch you up. Seewhat the husbandmen say about seeds when there is warm weather too early. Theyare afraid lest the seeds should be too luxuriant, and then a single frostshould lay hold of them and show that they are too forward. Do you alsoconsider, my man: you have shot out too soon, you have hurried toward a littlefame before the proper season: you think that you are something, a fool amongfools: you will be caught by the frost, and rather you have been frost-bittenin the root below, but your upper parts still blossom a little, and for thisreason you think that you are still alive and flourishing. Allow us to ripen inthe natural way: why do you bare us? why do you force us? we are not yet ableto bear the air. Let the root grow, then acquire the first joint, then thesecond, and then the third: in this way, then, the fruit will naturally forceitself out, even if I do not choose. For who that is pregnant and I filled withsuch great principles does not also perceive his own powers and move toward thecorresponding acts? A bull is not ignorant of his own nature and his powers,when a wild beast shows itself, nor does he wait for one to urge him on; nor adog when he sees a wild animal. But if I have the powers of a good man, shall Iwait for you to prepare me for my own acts? At present I have them not, believeme. Why then do you wish me to be withered up before the time, as you have beenwithered up?

To a person who had been changed to a character of shamelessness
</p>

<p>
    When you see another man in the possession of power, set against this thefact that you have not the want of power; when you see another rich, see whatyou possess in place of riches: for if you possess nothing in place of them,you are miserable; but if you have not the want of riches, know that youpossess more than this man possesses and what is worth much more. Another manpossesses a handsome woman: you have the satisfaction of not desiring ahandsome wife. Do these things appear to you to he small? And how much wouldthese persons give, these very men who are rich and in possession of power, andlive with handsome women, to be able to despise riches and power and these verywomen whom they love and enjoy? Do you not know, then, what is the thirst of aman who has a fever? He possesses that which is in no degree like the thirst ofa man who is in health: for the man who is in health ceases to be thirsty afterhe has drunk; but the sick man, being pleased for a short time, has a nausea;he converts the drink into bile, vomits, is griped, and more thirsty. It issuch a thing to have desire of riches and to possess riches, desire of powerand to possess power, desire of a beautiful woman and to sleep with her: tothis is added jealousy, fear of being deprived of the thing which you love,indecent words, indecent thoughts, unseemly acts.    "And what do I lose?" you will say. My man, you were modest, and you are sono longer. Have you lost nothing? In place of Chrysippus and Zeno you readAristides and Evenus; have you lost nothing? In place of Socrates and Diogenes,you admire him who is able to corrupt and seduce most women. You wish to appearhandsome and try to make yourself so, though you are not. You like to displaysplendid clothes that you may attract women; and if you find any fine oil, yonimagine that you are happy. But formerly you did not think of any such thing,but only where there should be decent talk, a worthy man, and a generousconception. Therefore you slept like a man, walked forth like a man, wore amanly dress, and used to talk in a way becoming a good man; then do you say tome, "I have lost nothing?" So do men lose nothing more than coin? Is notmodesty lost? Is not decent behavior lost? is it that he who has lost thesethings has sustained no loss? Perhaps you think that not one of these things isa loss. But there was a time when you reckoned this the only loss and damage,and you were anxious that no man should disturb you from these words andactions.    Observe, you are disturbed from these good words and actions by nobody butby yourself. Fight with yourself, restore yourself to decency, to modesty, toliberty. If any man ever told you this about me, that a person forces me to bean adulterer, to wear such a dress as yours, to perfume myself with oils, wouldyou not have gone and with your own hand have killed the man who thuscalumniated me? Now will you not help yourself? and how much easier is thishelp? There is no need to kill any man, nor to put him in chains, nor to treathim with contumely, nor to enter the Forum, but it is only necessary for you tospeak to yourself who will be the most easily persuaded, with whom no man hasmore power of persuasion than yourself. First of all, condemn what you aredoing, and then, when you have condemned it, do not despair of yourself, and benot in the condition of those men of mean spirit, who, when they have oncegiven in, surrender themselves completely and are carried away as if by atorrent. But see what the trainers of boys do. Has the boy fallen? "Rise," theysay, "wrestle again till you are made strong." Do you also do something of thesame kind: for be well assured that nothing is more tractable than the humansoul. You must exercise the will, and the thing is done, it is set right: as onthe other hand, only fall a-nodding, and the thing is lost: for from withincomes ruin and from within comes help. "Then what good do I gain?" And whatgreater good do you seek than this? From a shameless man you will become amodest man, from a disorderly you will become an orderly man, from a faithlessyou will become a faithful man, from a man of unbridled habits a sober man. Ifyou seek anything more than this, go on doing what you are doing: not even aGod can now help you.

Chapter 10

<p>
What things we ought to despise, and what things we ought to value
</p>

<p>
    The difficulties of all men are about external things, their helplessnessis about externals. "What shall I do, how will it be, how will it turn out,will this happen, will that?" All these are the words of those who are turningthemselves to things which are not within the power of the will. For who says,"How shall I not assent to that which is false? how shall I not turn away fromthe truth?" If a man be of such a good disposition as to be anxious about thesethings, I will remind him of this: "Why are you anxious? The thing is in yourown power: be assured: do not be precipitate in assenting before you apply thenatural rule." On the other side, if a man is anxious about desire, lest itfail in its purpose and miss its end, and with respect to the avoidance ofthings, lest he should fall into that which he would avoid, I will first kisshim, because he throws away the things about which others are in a flutter, andtheir fears, and employs his thoughts about his own affairs and his owncondition. Then I shall say to him: "If you do not choose to desire that whichyou will fall to obtain nor to attempt to avoid that into which you will fall,desire nothing which belongs to others, nor try to avoid any of the thingswhich are not in your power. If you do not observe this rule, you must ofnecessity fall in your desires and fall into that which you would avoid. Whatis the difficulty here? where is there room for the words, 'How will it be?'and 'How will it turn out?' and, 'Will this happen or that?'    Now is not that which will happen independent of the will? "Yes." And thenature of good and of evil, is it not in the things which are within the powerof the will? "Yes." Is it in your power, then, to treat according to natureeverything which happens? Can any person hinder you? "No man." No longer thensay to me, "How will it be?" For however it may be, you will dispose of itwell, and the result to you will be a fortunate one. What would Hercules havebeen if he had said, "How shall a great lion not appear to me, or a great boar,or savage men?" And what do you care for that? If a great boar appear, you willfight a greater fight: if bad men appear, you relieve the earth of the bad."Suppose, then, that I may lose my life in this way." You will die a good man,doing a noble act. For since we must certainly die, of necessity a man must befound doing something, either following the employment of a husbandman, ordigging, or trading, or serving in a consulship or suffering from indigestionor from diarrhea. What then do you wish to be doing, when you are found bydeath? I for my part would wish to be found doing something which belongs to aman, beneficent, suitable to the general interest, noble. But if I cannot befound doing things so great, I would be found doing at least that which Icannot be hindered from doing, that which is permitted me to do, correcting,myself, cultivating the faculty which makes use of appearances, labouring atfreedom from the affects, rendering to the relations of life their due; if Isucceed so far, also touching on the third topic, safety in the formingjudgements about things. If death surprises me when I am busy about thesethings, it is enough for me if I can stretch out my hands to God and say:    "The means which I have received from Thee for seeing Thy administrationand following it, I have not neglected: I have not dishonoured Thee by my acts:see how I have used my perceptions, see how I have used my preconceptions: haveI ever blamed Thee? have I been discontented with anything that happens, orwished it to be otherwise? have I wished to transgress the relations? That Thouhast given me life, I thank Thee for what Thou has given me: so long as I haveused the things which are Thine, I am content; take them back and place themwherever Thou mayest choose; for Thine were all things, Thou gavest them tome." Is it not enough to depart in this state of mind, and what life is betterand more becoming than that of a man who is in this state of mind? and what endis more happy?    But that this may be done, a man must receive no small things, nor are thethings small which he must lose. You cannot both wish to be a consul and tohave these things, and to be eager to have lands and these things also; and tobe solicitous about slaves and about yourself. But if you wish for anythingwhich belongs to another, that which is your own is lost. This is the nature ofthe thing: nothing is given or had for nothing. And where is the wonder? If youwish to be a consul, you must keep awake, run about, kiss hands, waste yourselfwith exhaustion at other men's doors, say and do many things unworthy of a freeman, send gifts to many, daily presents to some. And what is the thing that isgot? Twelve bundles of rods, to sit three or four times on the tribunal, toexhibit the games in the Circus and to give suppers in small baskets. Or, ifyou do not agree about this, let some one show me what there is besides thesethings. In order, then, to secure freedom from passions, tranquillity, to sleepwell when you do sleep, to be really awake when you are awake, to fear nothing,to be anxious about nothing, will you spend nothing and give no labour? But ifanything belonging to you be lost while you are thus busied, or be wastedbadly, or another obtains what you ought to have obtained, will you immediatelybe vexed at what has happened? Will you not take into the account on the otherside what you receive and for what, how much for how much? Do you expect tohave for nothing things so great? And how can you? One work has no communitywith another. You cannot have both external things after bestowing care on themand your own ruling faculty: but if you would have those, give up this. If youdo not, you will have neither this nor that, while you are drawn in differentways to both. The oil will be spilled, the household vessels will perish: but Ishall be free from passions. There will be a fire when I am not present, andthe books will be destroyed: but I shall treat appearances according to nature."Well; but I shall have nothing to eat." If I am so unlucky, death is aharbour; and death is the harbour for all; this is the place of refuge; and forthis reason not one of the things in life is difficult: as soon as you choose,you are out of the house, and are smoked no more. Why, then, are you anxious,why do you lose your sleep, why do you not straightway, after consideringwherein your good is and your evil, say, "Both of them are in my power? Neithercan any man deprive me of the good, nor involve me in the bad against my will.Why do I not throw myself down and snore? for all that I have is safe. As tothe things which belong to others, he will look to them who gets them, as theymay be given by Him who has the power. Who am I who wish to have them in thisway or in that? is a power ofselecting them given to me? has any person made methe dispenser of them? Those things are enough for me over which I have power:I ought to manage them as well as I can: and all the rest, as the Master ofthem may choose."    When a man has these things before his eyes, does he keep awake and turnhither and thither? What would he have, or what does he regret, Patroclus orAntilochus or Menelaus? For when did he suppose that any of his friends wasimmortal, and when had he not before his eyes that on the morrow or the dayafter he or his friend must die? "Yes," he says, "but I thought that he wouldsurvive me and bring up my son." You were a fool for that reason, and you werethinking of what was uncertain. Why, then, do you not blame yourself, and sitcrying like girls? "But he used to set my food before me." Because he wasalive, you fool, but now he cannot: but Automedon will set it before you, andif Automedon also dies, you will find another. But if the pot, in which yourmeat was cooked, should be broken, must you die of hunger, because you have notthe pot which you are accustomed to? Do you not send and buy a new pot? Hesays:       "No greater ill could fall on me."Why is this your ill? Do you, then, instead of removing it, blame your motherfor not foretelling it to you that you might continue grieving from that time?What do you think? do you not suppose that Homer wrote this that we may learnthat those of noblest birth, the strongest and the richest, the most handsome,when they have not the opinions which they ought to have, are not preventedfrom being most wretched and unfortunate?

About Purity
</p>

<p>
    Some persons raise a question whether the social feeling is contained inthe nature of man; and yet I think that these same persons would have no doubtthat love of purity is certainly contained in it, and that, if man isdistinguished from other animals by anything, he is distinguished by this.When, then, we see any other animal cleaning itself, we are accustomed to speakof the act with surprise, and to add that the animal is acting like a man: and,on the other hand, if a man blames an animal for being dirty, straightway as ifwe were making an excuse for it, we say that of course the animal is not ahuman creature. So we suppose that there is something superior in man, and thatwe first receive it from the Gods. For since the Gods by their nature are pureand free from corruption, so far as men approach them by reason, so far do theycling to purity and to a love of purity. But since it is impossible that man'snature can be altogether pure being mixed of such materials, reason is applied,as far as it is possible, and reason endeavours to make human nature love    The first, then, and highest purity is that which is in the soul; and wesay the same of impurity. Now you could not discover the impurity of the soulas you could discover that of the body: but as to the soul, what else could youfind in it than that which makes it filthy in respect to the acts which are herown? Now the acts of the soul are movement toward an object or movement fromit, desire, aversion, preparation, design, assent. What, then, is it which inthese acts makes the soul filthy and impure? Nothing else than her own badjudgements. Consequently, the impurity of the soul is the soul's bad opinions;and the purification of the soul is the planting in it of proper opinions; andthe soul is pure which has proper opinions, for the soul alone in her own actsis free from perturbation and pollution.    Now we ought to work at something like this in the body also, as far as wecan. It was impossible for the defluxions of the nose not to run when man hassuch a mixture in his body. For this reason, nature has made hands and thenostrils themselves as channels for carrying off the humours. If, then, a mansucks up the defluxions, I say that he is not doing the act of a man. It wasimpossible for a man's feet not to be made muddy and not be soiled at all whenhe passes through dirty places. For this reason, nature has made water andhands. It was impossible that some impurity should not remain in the teeth fromeating: for this reason, she says, wash the teeth. Why? In order that you maybe a man and not a wild beast or a hog. It was impossible that from the sweatand the pressing of the clothes there should not remain some impurity about thebody which requires to be cleaned away. For this reason water, oil, hands,towels, scrapers, nitre, sometimes all other kinds of means are necessary forcleaning the body. You do not act so: but the smith will take off the rust fromthe iron, and be will have tools prepared for this purpose, and you yourselfwash the platter when you are going to eat, if you are not completely impureand dirty: but will you not wash the body nor make it clean? "Why?" he replies.I will tell you again; in the first place, that you may do the acts of a man;then, that you may not be disagreeable to those with whom you associate. You dosomething of this kind even in this matter, and you do not perceive it: youthink that you deserve to stink. Let it be so: deserve to stink. Do you thinkthat also those who sit by you, those who recline at table with you, that thosewho kiss you deserve the same? Either go into a desert, where you deserve togo, or live by yourself, and smell yourself. For it is just that you aloneshould enjoy your own impurity. But when you are in a city, to behave soinconsiderately and foolishly, to what character do you think that it belongs?If nature had entrusted to you a horse, would you have overlooked and neglectedhim? And now think that you have been intrusted with your own body as with ahorse; wash it, wipe it, take care that no man turns away from it, that no onegets out of the way for it. But who does not get out of the way of a dirty man,of a stinking man, of a man whose skin is foul, more than he does out of theway of a man who is daubed with muck? That smell is from without, it is putupon him; but the other smell is from want of care, from within, and in amanner from a body in putrefaction.    "But Socrates washed himself seldom." Yes, but his body was clean and fair:and it was so agreeable and sweet that tile most beautiful and the most nobleloved him, and desired to sit by him rather than by the side of those who hadthe handsomest forms. It was in his power neither to use the bath nor to washhimself, if he chose; and yet the rare use of water had an effect. If you donot choose to wash with warm water, wash with cold. But Aristophanes says:       Those who are pale, unshod, 'tis those I mean.For Aristophanes says of Socrates that he also walked the air and stole clothesfrom the palaestra. But all who have written about Socrates bear exactly thecontrary evidence in his favour; they say that he was pleasant not only tohear, but also to see. On the other hand they write the same about Diogenes.For we ought not even by the appearance of the body to deter the multitude fromphilosophy; but as in other things, a philosopher should show himself cheerfuland tranquil, so also he should in the things that relate to the body: "See, yemen, that I have nothing, that I want nothing: see how I am without a house,and without a city, and an exile, if it happens to be so, and without a hearthI live more free from trouble and more happily than all of noble birth and thanthe rich. But look at my poor body also and observe that it is not injured bymy hard way of living." But if a man says this to me, who has the appearanceand face of a condemned man, what God shall persuade me to approach philosophy,if it makes men such persons? Far from it; I would not choose to do so, even ifI were going to become a wise man. I indeed would rather that a young man, whois making his first movements toward philosophy, should come to me with hishair carefully trimmed than with it dirty and rough, for there is seen in him acertain notion of beauty and a desire of that which is becoming; and where hesupposes it to be, there also he strives that it shall be. It is only necessaryto show him, and to say: "Young man, you seek beauty, and you do well: you mustknow then that it grows in that part of you where you have the rationalfaculty: seek it there where you have the movements toward and the movementsfrom things, where you have the desire toward, ind the aversion from things:for this is what you have in yourself of a superior kind; but the poor body isnaturally only earth: why do you labour about it to no purpose? if you shalllearn nothing else, you will learn from time that the body is nothing." But ifa man comes to me daubed with filth, dirty, with a mustache down to his knees,what can I say to him, by what kind of resemblance can I lead him on? For aboutwhat has he busied himself which resembles beauty, that I may be able to changehim and "Beauty is not in this, but in that?" Would you have me to tell him,that beauty consists not in being daubed with muck, but that it lies in therational part? Has he any desire of beauty? has he any form of it in his mind?Go and talk to a hog, and tell him not to roll in the mud.    For this reason the words of Xenocrates touched Polemon also; since he wasa lover of beauty, for he entered, having in him certain incitements to love ofbeauty, but he looked for it in the wrong place. For nature has not made eventhe animals dirty which live with man. Does a horse ever wallow in the mud or awell-bred dog? But the hog, and the dirty geese, and worms and spiders do,which are banished furthest from human intercourse. Do you, then, being a man,choose to be not as one of the animals which live with man, but rather a worm,or a spider? Will you not wash yourself somewhere some time in such manner asyou choose? Will you not wash off the dirt from your body? Will you not comeclean that those with whom you keep company may have pleasure in being withyou? But do you go with us even into the temples in such a state, where it isnot permitted to spit or blow the nose, being a heap of spittle and of snot?    When then? does any man require you to ornament yourself? Far from it;except to ornament that which we really are by nature, the rational faculty,the opinions, the actions; but as to the body only so far as purity, only sofar as not to give offense. But if you are told that you ought not to weargarments dyed with purple, go and daub your cloak with muck or tear it. "Buthow shall I have a neat cloak?" Man, you have water; wash it. Here is a youthworthy of being loved, here is an old man worthy of loving and being loved inreturn, a fit person for a man to intrust to him a son's instruction, to whomdaughters and young men shall come, if opportunity shall so happen, that theteacher shall deliver his lessons to them on a dunghill. Let this not be so:every deviation comes from something which is in man's nature; but this is nearbeing something not in man's nature.

On attention
</p>

<p>
    When you have remitted your attention for a short time, do not imaginethis, that you will recover it when you choose; but let but let this thought bepresent to you, that in consequence of the fault committed to-day your affairsmust be in a worse condition for all that follows. For first, and what causesmost trouble, a habit of not attending is formed in you; then a habit ofdeferring your attention. And continually from time to time you drive away, bydeferring it, the happiness of life, proper behavior, the being and livingconformably to nature. If, then, the procrastination of attention isprofitable, the complete omission of attention is more profitable; but if it isnot profitable, why do you not maintain your attention constant? "To-day Ichoose to play." Well then, ought you not to play with attention? "I choose tosing." What, then, hinders you from doing so with attention? Is there any partof life excepted, to which attention does not extend? For will you do it worseby using attention, and better by not attending at all? And what else of thingsin life is done better by those who do not use attention? Does he who works inwood work better by not attending to it? Does the captain of a ship manage itbetter by not attending? and is any of the smaller acts done better byinattention? Do you not see that, when you have let your mind loose, it is nolonger in your power to recall it, either to propriety, or to modesty, or tomoderation: but you do everything that comes into your mind in obedience toyour inclinations?    To what things then ought I to attend? First to those general (principles)and to have them in readiness, and without them not to sleep, not to rise, notto drink, not to eat, not to converse with men; that no man is master ofanother man's will, but that in the will alone is the good and the bad. No man,then, has the power either to procure for me any good or to involve me in anyevil, but I alone myself over myself have power in these things. When, then,these things are secured to me, why need I be disturbed about external things?What tyrant is formidable, what disease, what poverty, what offense? "Well, Ihave not pleased a certain person." Is he then my work, my judgement? "No." Whythen should I trouble myself about him? "But he is supposed to be some one." Hewill look to that himself; and those who think so will also. But I have OneWhom I ought to please, to Whom I ought to subject myself, Whom I ought toobey, God and those who are next to Him. He has placed me with myself, and hasput my will in obedience to myself alone, and has given me rules for the rightuse of it; and when I follow these rules in syllogisms, I do not care for anyman who says anything else: in sophistical argument, I care for no man. Whythen in greater matters do those annoy me who blame me? What is the cause ofthis perturbation? Nothing else than because in this matter I am notdisciplined. For all knowledge despises ignorance and the ignorant; and notonly the sciences, but even the arts. Produce any shoemaker that you please,and he ridicules the many in respect to his own work. Produce any carpenter.    First, then, we ought to have these in readiness, and to do nothing withoutthem, and we ought to keep the soul directed to this mark, to pursue nothingexternal, and nothing which belongs to others, but to do as He has appointedWho has the power; we ought to pursue altogether the things which are in thepower of the will, and all other things as it is permitted. Next to this weought to remember who we are, and what is our name, and to endeavour to directour duties toward the character of our several relations in this manner: whatis the season for singing, what is the season for play, and in whose presence;what will be the consequence of the act; whether our associates will despiseus, whether we shall despise them; when to jeer, and whom to ridicule; and onwhat occasion to comply and with whom; and finally, in complying how tomaintain our own character. But wherever you have deviated from any of theserules, there is damage immediately, not from anything external, but from theaction itself.    What then? is it possible to be free from faults? It is not possible; buttills is possible, to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultless. Forwe must be content if by never remitting this attention we shall escape atleast a few errors. But now when you have said, "To-morrow I will begin toattend," you must be told that you are saying this, "To-day I will beshameless, disregardful of time and place, mean; it will be in the power ofothers to give me pain; to-day I will be passionate and envious." See how manyevil things you are permitting yourself to do. If it is good to use attentionto-morrow, how much better is it to do so to-day? if to-morrow it is in yourinterest to attend, much more is it to-day, that you may be able to do soto-morrow also, and may not defer it again to the third day.

Against or to those who readily tell their own affairs
</p>

<p>
    When a man has seemed to us to have talked with simplicity about his ownaffairs, how is it that at last we are ourselves also induced to discover tohim our own secrets and we think this to be candid behavior? In the firstplace, because it seems unfair for a man to have listened to the affairs of hisneighbour, and not to communicate to him also in turn our own affairs: next,because we think that we shall not present to them the appearance of candid menwhen we are silent about our own affairs. Indeed men are often accustomed tosay, "I have told you all my affairs, will you tell me nothing of your own?where is this done?" Besides, we have also this opinion that we can safelytrust him who has already told us his own affairs; for the notion rises in ourmind that this man could never divulge our affairs because he would be cautiousthat we also should not divulge his. In this way also the incautious are caughtby the soldiers at Rome. A soldier sits by you in a common dress and begins tospeak ill of Caesar; then you, as if you had received a pledge of his fidelityby his having begun the abuse, utter yourself also what you think, and then youare carried off in chains.    Something of this kind happens to us generally. Now as this man hasconfidently intrusted his affairs to me, shall I also do so to any man whom Imeet? For when I have heard, I keep silence, if I am of such a disposition; buthe goes forth and tells all men what he has heard. Then if I hear what has beendone, if I be a man like him, I resolve to be revenged, I divulge what he hastold me; I both disturb others and am disturbed myself. But if I remember thatone man does not injure another, and that every man's acts injure and profithim, I secure this, that I do not anything like him, but still I suffer what Ido suffer through my own silly talk.    "True: but it is unfair when you have heard the secrets of your neighbourfor you in turn to communicate nothing to him." Did I ask you for your secrets,my man? did you communicate your affairs on certain terms, that you should inreturn hear mine also? If you are a babbler and think that all who meet you arefriends, do you wish me also to be like you? But why, if you did well inentrusting your affairs to me, and it is not well for me to intrust mine toyou, do you wish me to be so rash? It is just the same as if I had a cask whichis water-tight, and you one with a hole in it, and you should come and depositwith me your wine that I might put it into my cask, and then should complainthat I also did not intrust my wine to you, for you have a cask with a hole init. How then is there any equality here? You intrusted your affairs to a manwho is faithful and modest, to a man who thinks that his own actions alone areinjurious and useful, and that nothing external is. Would you have me intrustmine to you, a man who has dishonoured his own faculty of will, and who wishesto gain some small bit of money or some office or promotion in the court, evenif you should be going to murder your own children, like Medea? Where is thisequality? But show yourself to me to be faithful, modest, and steady: show methat you have friendly opinions; show that your cask has no hole in it; and youwill see how I shall not wait for you to trust me with your affairs, but Imyself shall come to you and ask you to hear mine. For who does not choose tomake use of a good vessel? Who does not value a benevolent and faithfuladviser? who will not willingly receive a man who is ready to bear a share, aswe may say, of the difficulty of his circumstances, and by this very act toease the burden, by taking a part of it.    "True: but I trust you; you do not trust me." In the first place, not evendo you trust me, but you are a babbler, and for this reason you cannot holdanything; for indeed, if it is true that you trust me, trust your affairs to meonly; but now, whenever you see a man at leisure, you seat yourself by him andsay: "Brother, I have no friend more benevolent than you nor dearer; I requestyou to listen to my affairs." And you do this even to those who are not knownto you at all. But if you really trust me, it is plain that you trust mebecause I am faithful and modest, not because I have told my affairs to you.Allow me, then, to have the same opinion about you. Show me that, if one mantells his affairs to another, he who tells them is faithful and modest. For ifthis were so, I would go about and tell my affairs to every man, if that wouldmake me faithful and modest. But the thing is not so, and it requires no commonopinions. If, then, you see a man who is busy about things not dependent on hiswill and subjecting his will to them, you must know that this man has tenthousand persons to compel and hinder him. He has no need of pitch or the wheelto compel him to declare what he knows: but a little girl's nod, if it shouldso happen, will move him, the blandishment of one who belongs to Caesar'scourt, desire of a magistracy or of an inheritance, and things without end ofthat sort. You must remember, then, among general principles that secretdiscourses require fidelity and corresponding opinions. But where can we nowfind these easily? Or if you cannot answer that question, let some one pointout to me a man who can say: "I care only about the things which are my own,the things which are not subject to hindrance, the things which are by naturefree." This I hold to be the nature of the good: but let all other things be asthey are allowed; I do not concern myself.
