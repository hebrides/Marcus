<p>Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher born into slavery. His teachings were recorded by his pupil Arrian in the 'Discourses' and 'Enchiridion'. Epictetus believed that philosophy is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. His works focus on the importance of maintaining personal freedom and tranquility through the rational control of one's thoughts and perceptions.</p>
