     <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>In this policy, "The Aurelius Fund" refers to The Aurelius Fund staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they receive as part of their assistance to The Aurelius Fund.</p>
    <p>The Aurelius Fund does not sell application user or website visitor information under any circumstances, and we do not share this information without prior consent except as compelled by law. The Aurelius Fund is located within the United States, and therefore will transfer, process, and store your information in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>Logging:</strong> For visitors to our website, our site server logs minimal information about requests and generally purges this information after seven days. Circumstances in which The Aurelius Fund may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for The Aurelius Fund’s mission and functionality, including situations such as: site testing, diagnosis of technical problems, defending against attacks to the site, handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal, short-term circumstances. We will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> The Aurelius Fund may gather information for analyzing our website and how visitors move within it without compromising the privacy of our visitors. The Aurelius Fund’s website logging service may log the IP address, as well as the referrer page, time stamp, page requested, user agent, language header, website visited, and a hash of all of this information. After seven days only aggregate information from these logs may be stored. We also may geolocate IP addresses before anonymizing them and store only the country.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> We do not use persistent ID cookies on this site. Where possible, we take steps to limit the ability of third parties to retain data about our users. These service providers may place session cookies on your computer. The Aurelius Fund’s service providers may also log standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. Our service providers may also store and organize the personal information collected through this site on our behalf. The Aurelius Fund’s third party providers primarily process information in the United States, but may process data in other jurisdictions.
    <p><strong>Retention:</strong> The Aurelius Fund’s server logs are stored and retained as explained above in the section on logging. If you communicate with The Aurelius Fund, we may keep records of those communications indefinitely. If we inadvertently collect more personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information. When we no longer need to retain information or when deleting information on request, we endeavor to remove all copies. However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.</p>
    <p><strong>Security:</strong> The Aurelius Fund employs industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by The Aurelius Fund in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>

            "Be full and without a want of any kind,

                longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything."


                                 --Chapter X, Verse I.




        “Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons

               why he is right not to sacrifice himself."


                  ―-Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago
