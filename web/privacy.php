Preamble:

In our digital age, the tracking of individuals through technology has become prevalent, utilized by advertisers, governments, and security services alike. At the Aurelius Fund, we view such practices as fundamentally dystopian.

We assert that security services must be required to obtain hard-to-acquire warrants prior to any surveillance activities. Every citizen has the right to freedom from the perils associated with unchecked governmental intrusion into their private lives.

Moreover, the existence of private data brokerage stands as a stark affront to privacy, turning the joy of technology use into a source of unease. Surveillance-based advertising, in particular, is invasive and detracts from the integrity of digital experiences. There are far more honorable methods to generate revenue. Consumers rightfully deserve their privacy in every interaction with commercial products.

We advocate for robust legislation that upholds privacy as an inalienable human right, as recognized in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ensuring its protection across both commercial and governmental spheres.
