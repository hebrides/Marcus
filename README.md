# MEDITATIONS 

Simple native iOS app for reading Marcus Aurelius's Meditations.

NOTE: In 2019, Apple rejected this because they said it was a book. The nerve. Books don't send you daily quotes, do they? As a result we'll make this into a website. In the meantime, check out the branch QOD, which has the ToS and PP page for the app, and a QOD script.
